Unknown Speaker  0:01  
By way of today, I will display briefly mentioned the program which you should all you can download if you haven't got its own rotating slides out in the front. I'm not going to take you through that, but we're really excited to welcome your back face to face. We're really excited about the program, which is fantastic. There's been a couple of last minute changes. I thank you very much for your forbearance with these. I'm going to particularly thank Abigail Paige, who came in at a very late stage and offered us a talk to fill the gaps are very grateful to me for that. So that's the program is we think is really exciting and we think is gonna be a great day. It'll be wonderful to chat to people as we go through the day. And just a little bit about AGI Scotland, it has gotten part of AGI nationally, we're about making it locally. I thought I'd just take a second or two to tell you some of the things that we are doing. Oops, that's like we're working very closely. I will occasionally to Scotland in terms of enabling their aims for growing our sector through the geospatial economy in Scotland, we particularly are doing a lot of work on education, trading skills, because that's really, really important in terms of developing our sector, getting new people into our sector and meeting the demand has a huge amount of demand much more international students conversation at the end of the day week sending partnerships with Scottish Government, with Scotland is with data lab and others very working very actively to the benefits of our sector. And we're considering new spider new partnerships. Again, extending our community going far beyond its face, as we all know, it's nice to see a lot of faces I don't recognize you actually be really important in terms of what we do. And we are trying to communicate effectively. So through events like this today, which is our principal annual events through our ATI II have seminars which take place regularly through the year through social media. So keep in touch with us do make this the first events of HS come along to the first one that you're coming to today. And finally our careers network we're again working in terms of bringing new people into the profession, developing those younger colleagues, and my older market is here. She will be at the registration desk where you have your badges if you want to connect with her in terms of their careers network and there are events happening in terms of early careers there will be to keep your ear to grind. Chances are, you know what's going on. Do get involved so we also have a new Knowledge Hub network for the geospatial community which is getting quite active in terms of posting questions, whether they be technical questions, whether they be a question of policy and data and so on. So sign up or get involved with that and it didn't get involved with the API Scotland committee. We're not exclusive. We're absolutely welcoming enthusiastic. New people will take on boards. So come and help default with our events. If there's something you want us to do if there's something you want to influence us in terms of get involved and help with that. As part of that, I would like to thank the committee particularly the Organising Committee for this event, a particularly Ryan's Peter, Marie, James, Simon, Nikki and many others apologize and also their organizations for getting informed to get involved with the events I think, particularly foreign solutions is good for the fight so I just want to call them out for that. And we also do crucial slides Yes. And they thanks to our sponsors, we might not be able to run this event data lab as UKG Ovation so fun or the Soviet guys we are very, very grateful to you because we love this event. I hope you have a successful event today. And finally, last but not least, connect to the Wi Fi These are details there. They are also eyesight. So if you don't get those magic numbers on the slide pops off, and you can find these outside. I think that's all I've got to see. So thank you very much indeed I do. Welcome to this event. I'm very, very pleased to see you face to face which is really nice to see to see a lot of new faces than we possibly can see to the board. So without further ado, I will jumping in place I will introduce the procession and chilling over to

Unknown Speaker  5:08  
somebody might be very painful. But it makes you think can I do this? I'm gonna be quick. We got a session we're already currently running late. I was actually planning to cancel. I've been asked to introduce the authority, adaptability and involving energy masking. This is a bit odd, but if I say that my question was about to focus, and the oil industry Peterhead and my dad worked in the very early on as well. I do have some connections. So I'm gonna introduce you to the three speakers. We've got we've got 20 minutes for their talk. I haven't set stopwatch so I would say to the best of you, John, if you want to get up you need to get his face on it. And I will be waving at you and he gets annoyed that you told her time you can deal with consequences afterwards. I don't know b but I'm assuming that she will tell you to shut up if she needs to. So we have John cbord. John is the Chief Digital Information Officer at NSTA. The remit to lead the digital transformation of the organization. This involves collaboration and CO production with the government, industry and regulators to accelerate the move to net zero of y'all accelerating the move to net zero. He has also been integral in the development of ntsad digital energy platform. You guessed it right he'll hand off to Tanya Knowles. Tanya within NCS manages a multidisciplinary team that leads on the development of the data warehouse GIS, bi and web compatibilities. She now oversees the evolution of NSPA open data portal ensuring that data is made available to as wide an audience as possible. Including supporting data sharing with key stakeholders. And finally hopefully if it colleagues get it right, we'll hear from B. B's GIS specialists who started a professional career mapping butterfly species. She now works for MSC supporting their geospatial technologies. She's passionate about unlocking the value of NSPA status for energy transition as a planner I would say anything that unlocks analyzes aftermath is good with me overview John goes, I'm gonna set my stopwatch when I get back.

Unknown Speaker  7:03  
No problem. Thank you. My perspective, the most interesting thing about talk is definitely the more about geospatial but this has kind of set the tone a little bit. Thank you. Wherever your behalf from AGI as a council member. Really great to see people back in person. Really nice to see it's really really active the community here in Scotland as well. But this is my day job. I am Chief Information and Digital Officer at the MSBA we were previously known as the oil and gas authority. So we are the regulator of the gas industry and carbon capture and storage industry in the UK, by any organization because we're not impacted by devolution. We are responsible for the entirety of the Economic Zone, which means we work very closely with all of my colleagues across all of the Volta ministration and with central government. I'll talk a little bit about our remit. So we were created back in 2014. So we do a kind of well served by a coalition government, which last count was probably about 35 governments. But what happened after that was the idea of breaking down organizations working with industry, working with government and Treasury and then having us in the middle of that. And what that gave us the power to do is two things one being more forceful and regulating the industry in a much more powerful way, but also in legislation have a remitted influence of behaviors of that industry. And we've done that in multiple different ways over the years and using spatial data to monitor. We work across these kinds of three different areas. So really kind of important for us to be aware of kind of the energy situation and that's really been important over the last couple of years as we look at what's going on in Europe at the moment of transition is becoming even more important to us. And that was part of our reason for a name change from the oil and gas authority to transition authority. It's all about getting this from reliance on fossil fuels into a world where we need much more greener energy, but balancing that with our net zero and security. And then the big moments and so it's been just a minute it goes the same value without getting less value as we can out of new KPRC. So this means influencing sector and making sure that we have a really strong supply chain embedded in this country. So that expertise can be sold anywhere around the world. So really nice example that is making sure that tastes like Aberdeen or a sense of the decommissioning excellence, and then that knowledge and that ability can be exported to anywhere around the world. What's that mean for us from a digital perspective? So I'm quite proud of the fact that we managed to get digital and innovation as one of our kind of key pillars in what we're doing in that kind of value. And there's been a whole load of strategic things that have come out of central government, the devolved administration's over the last few years. And what that's really done is set the direction for us. We've then been able to put into the primary legislation in the Energy Act 2016 some absolutely incredible power. So the only role you actually need to operate in the UK is something called information and samples coordinators is a data person who must be in that company who is responsible to provide the data and when I asked for it, incredible power that's elevated that kind of data industry within the sector. I made it quite important. And then we see the data come into us and enabled us to be able to use that to influence behavior. We've done quite a lot there now the action not sure the current use cases about open data. We're massive fans of this. It's been in place ever since I joined the organization back in 2014. We've built industry data repository, which meant seeing the data that was collected from oil and gas that's been used to how we can cite wind farms or have developed the public storage industry. And what that's really that's it for instance, a whole load of improved outcome, mainly better defined for data reporting, quicker responses back into us when we're asking operators. We find benchmarking companies which is free that meeting every year when we dropped into the top 20 operators and hold them to account for a little company like all of these API's. And nobody wants to be on the right hand side of those brands. And that's been some really good collaborations. Alongside that, then we have a digital strategy. We wrote this back in 2020. And then the pandemic happens so we might model for the first year because we did something very different one wrong we got myself privations, but what this has enabled us to do in a lot of the work that we're doing on Sundays. I can talk about all five of these. If you want to come and grab me a little bit later. We'll talk about these in a bit more detail from a genetic point of view but the one that I just wanted to share with the people massively important and it's that's on that list for a reason. The technology side of this for me, it's always a kind of easy, getting the right people and the right kind of attitude into your organization is massively important. With that and hopefully following their advice I'm going to finish on my bit and move on to some more interesting.

Unknown Speaker  12:07  
Cool, so I'm gonna talk a little bit about how the digital strategy actually applies to GIS and talk a little bit about how we got to where we are today. So you can understand our current challenges. So we started in 2016, with one web page a couple of links to some shapefiles and some PDF maps. So those were updated manually, which was a problem because on any given day, we can have so much happening across the North Sea. We can have well holes being drilled, you can have partners leaving licenses, new partnerships being formed. And we have data going back to the 1960s when the industry was formed, and we have a lot of data correction happening as well. So 2016 2006 Every night with FEMA support

Unknown Speaker  13:02  
system American Center

Unknown Speaker  13:11  
which was a game changer.

Unknown Speaker  13:19  
So let's also create a switch pretty

Unknown Speaker  13:31  
quick, we have

Unknown Speaker  13:41  
a specific purpose we have taken note

Unknown Speaker  13:48  
we have an awesome

Unknown Speaker  13:56  
platform.

Unknown Speaker  14:25  
changed this is why we change from the MTA to attend to definitive TV

Unknown Speaker  14:35  
ads and they get wrapped

Unknown Speaker  14:43  
up

Unknown Speaker  14:58  
help us work out how we do things. Because they couldn't be released before the announcements. We couldn't do anything changes ahead of time. And we do the announcement will be made on a Monday so we have to make sure that all of the changes could be done within a single weekend. Just to as quickly as possible, minimizing disruption as possible to our services. So we had some time to plan and we consulted a lot with athletes and I'd like to give a big shout out to Marie Rhoda, who helped a lot with the main change for us was the domain name changes. This meant that the URL for all of our data services, all of the documents and things we have on the as your storage blob that was going to change. We had to update all of the links in our website and the data site in the ArcGIS Online organization items. I'd also feed through to all of our scripts and workbenches that we use automate the updating of our data. And obviously if any of these links were remaining, they would break everything so we had to make sure we were doing it properly. So what we have a couple of tools that we're able to utilize sneak up for the ArcGIS Online organization we have a lot of items in them. You can find references to the ODA in the item name within summary within the description. So we're able to use the ArcGIS API for Python to create scripts to do a single operation. We can test it on development on our sites without breaking anything. So as we were able to get access to a new organization, we cloned all of our content onto the testing so that we knew it would work at the time. So in order to update all the layers in all of our web apps and apps, which also we needed to keep running smoothly, we use the RTS online assistant, which is a really handy tool. Surprisingly, we found a lot of references to NTA throughout our service. So this could be in the service name and it could also be in some of the field names and some of the actions within the data. So we created lots of Python scripts that return a list of all of our datasets find the DA and they replace the value with the tables that we prepared for. We wanted to make sure we can do most of this work upfront as possible to the universe children. So we did so when we had the entire team together and ran all the scripts and we built the technique and tried to make sure that everything was fine. So that on Monday morning when the new name was announced, and all of our Open Data Science, all of our services or our roadmaps, are still running smoothly and register today. Although this project was as fast as my computer and we want to make was just to make sure that we weren't using references, company names NSCA we need to be this especially with the services so as before we have a dataset we would call OG well that irritates me that's still a very descriptive name.

Unknown Speaker  18:37  
Okay, and then one of the most recent projects that we've been working on has been launched the first ever the EPS first ever carbon storage, which kicked off in June of last year. So these new carbon carbon storage areas are going to make a significant computation to the end of storing 20 to 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. And this round is going to be the first of many as we estimate up to as many as 100 new carbon storage areas will be needed to meet so this is a brand new process of the NSCA. And the GIS team will be taking all of our lessons learned from the majority of my 16 rounds and applying them to concert. So we're asking for applications to include that areas as a special format. Which makes it much easier to have put them together, send them off to the meeting. And we'll use the internal web maps for the entire review team to be able to see those application in context with all the other spatial data that they need to take their assessment. And when using internal edit services, so that the US make comments on areas of the applications that are looking at repeating we see these updates in real time. And as always in there, and then we always we will be reviewing and improving and awesome

Unknown Speaker  20:14  
so I'm just thinking about, again, how we face our challenges. And I've come up with these four things. As things we as a GIS team, keep in mind, so we now need to think about operating capacity. So anything, anything currently on our estate, we need to think about its value, its purpose and how much it costs. We will do that by getting feedback from users. We've already had a great relationships with our users. We talk to them regularly. But we don't know the specifics of how they use the data and how we can specifically values and especially the newer energy transition. I really want for the GIS team to still be a fun place to work for responsibility. But through experimentation and keeping our agile approach, we can keep coming up with great new ideas that will add value for our users and help us to continue to punch above our weight. And lastly, collaboration. It's been recognized in multiple places that for the energy transition to happen. We need to share data efficiently with other organizations to be able to be and John will talk a little bit more about that.

Unknown Speaker  21:37  
So the energy research app is a great successful collaborations with other organizations. So the NCAA has a lot of data, especially around the oil and gas infrastructure and dependency Scotland they've managed proportional and they have a loss of data, especially regarding offshore wind. So being civil and public entities and managing data in the North Sea, we'd often come into contact with like events like that, and we'd have any formal, informal conversations with each other where we share knowledge and practice. And it was any one of these conversations that we decided to work together. So each of the individual organizations was pulling data from the other organizations to get to the activity in the North Sea. Of that we decided that together we created a standalone app that pulls all of the data from all three organizations. It will benefit us as well as organizations will benefit our respective user groups, and then possibly even attract new users from new areas. So organizations worked hard to bring together these datasets and previously disparate data sets are all customized for their own organizations terminology of symbology so we have to pull them together into one cohesive map that was easy to navigate and easy to use. And we went through several cycles of redeeming feedback before we were ready to release the app public. We think it will be a really valuable resource in supporting decision making for the anti transition, especially things such as decommissioning, repurposing, and electrification. And overall, it's a fairly simple app. It's not complicated, but it's highly effective, or not the most potential way to use this in any individual dataset for organizations data would have on its own. And the app itself is easy to maintain. We use API so when we update the data, and explain how it's important to consider what data you want to share, but also making sure that you're sharing efficient way possible, because I don't think this app really has its mission proof of concept. It is going to be hard to maintain. So there are a lot of other benefits that came through from the collaboration. We still have very close ties with Scotland, and we obviously still do a lot of feedback and sharing information. We're able to look at our data in a fresh way outside of the context of oil and gas and try to appreciate just wider uses. So we do hope to do more collaborations, especially if any organizations have any data not see that people are out. And so many of our organization writing conventions we'd love to hear

Unknown Speaker  24:40  
from the final slide that means take that question a little bit further. So with his work during 2021 and 2022, I was on the organization's and see this on the left hand side of the slide that we did a piece of work and looked at half a dozen basically the better you see us and we are now starting to form a digital strategy that's already which involves some of the major regulators that are involved in oil and gas and renewables and say Scotland off Jen and the other organizations off the back of rather than a series of recommendations that are on the wall here and what we're trying to do is engage with that kind of broader community to come and join a few tasks with us. So if anyone is interested in getting more involved in that we're looking for kind of people to volunteer some of their time and provide some expertise. We're also looking for people that work outside about sector because we're great believers, they're learning from the other parts of society and where we see things that are happening in a real quick real nice agile ways, where we see examples of use of data try and bring back into our world. This is a really complicated landscape is a really complicated topic isn't really a motive. And I think it's a societal problem. And it'd be amazing for as a community to evolve. So check that out on my LinkedIn profiles. webinar time and that with that, in that time he enjoyed

Unknown Speaker  0:01  
And once you have connected, how do you leverage that to make your organization more effective? So, most of our work it's fair to say it is with the public sector. And we work with the UK Government on their 5 billion pound project gigabit wireless mobile funds. And we also work was an all of the combinations and with that collectively plans, as well as other public sector clients, work with local authorities, police forces, NHS courts. vast number of other people. So why is connectivity key well connected, you'll appreciate? I think that's probably the slide again. We live in a constantly changing world. The last two years have told us just how important connectivity is for how we live our lives. You know many of us have changed to work from home where we were able to even those who didn't work from home and we're probably communicating with people who did, whether that was teaching people whether that was you know, interacting with with other workers at school. But it's, it doesn't just apply to the workplace. You know, it's really important when we look at the impacts of climate change, you know, the word should be talked about in the previous session. You know, how we monitor climate change, how we help predict, you know, what we need to do about that, how we then make sure that the actions that we are taking are having the right impact. And also, you know, we just talked about budgets and changes to budgets. It's also important when we think about how the delivery of public services are changing, you know, where the Arctic and a very much digital first approach, you try and find a passport or driving license, you know, get your doctor's appointment, or any one of the 100 other things and organize the garden waste bin, etc. And they are all increasingly digital, people are participating in one of the issues that we've seen, though, is, you know, if we accept and I hope we do, that connectivity is kind of vital to how we live our lives. Also, we see connectivity and it's very much an afterthought, in lots of projects that we are involved in. So you know, I could give you lots of examples and if anyone wants to call me after the session, you know, in the break, I will happily talk to you about many, many examples of where this has been thought about at the very latest stages in a project. When it's more expensive, more complex. It reduces delays and really could be avoided if people were going forward. Let's jump forward to the slides. So you know how is connected Okay, so just as a few examples, you know, I've done a lot of work. I worked in the public sector for a long time myself, but in the work that we've done since, you know, we have previously had issues with the population of rural areas, people moving to cities and urban environments for jobs. And thankfully, last two years has told us that that doesn't have to be the case. We saw a huge increase in swing and people now looking for properties in more rural areas, so that they can work from home and enjoy all the benefits living in the rural area. You know, that helps with congestion. It helps with air quality if people aren't making as many journeys so that, you know, there are lots of benefits to that. And businesses you know, you told me your business at the moment that doesn't allow and contactless payment. That's a big shift over the last few years, you know, even to the point where you know a lot is on market stalls suddenly we're doing it will more happily take a contactless payment from you now than the cash that we used to take even just two or three years ago. And that all works with that connectivity, underpinning all of that. We're already seeing lots of changes in terms of health and social care, for lighting for connectivity for that, there are some real challenges with that. I'll be honest, in terms of the digital switch offs over the coming years, lots of those systems couldn't use analog phone lines. They won't work after 2025. There's a huge amount of work to be done in supporting that delivery of health and social care by making sure it has the right connectivity. Once like you know we talked about energy, obviously, you know, there is the production side of energy but as equally you know, how we as consumers of energy, monitor our use, how we, you know, make sure that optimum is monitored, you will have all seen the schemes that are now in place for people who have smart meters. Which are live on connectivity, where they can offset or shift their usage to less than less than nine times a day and be compensated for the charger at the top overnight at the start of our tea time. You know do your washing overnight, etc. We've actually the thought or for the center one is actually a bit of work that we did at your own monitoring people and and looking at how peatlands can be restored using IoT systems to see where it for actions or interventions are needed, you know, flood sensors. You know, we I wrote an article around detecting wildfires at the earliest stages. You know, if you could put a fire out when it's this big, rather than the size of several football pitches. That's a real winner. You could put it out with one fire engine instead. Of having to have 50 fire engines. And of course there is the decarbonisation electrification of our vehicles, autonomous vehicles. Edinburgh doesn't have so much in terms of micro mobility of higher bikes, which for those places that have connectivity is vital for access to those things, how you pay for them, how you only return using it even things like the Ultra Low Emission zones, which are like cameras etc. So it really is all pervasive. With that, I'm gonna hand it over to my colleague, Chris, just to talk about a few examples of some of the work that we've done, and how connectivity really does thread through recent

Unknown Speaker  6:34  
so I'm responding

Unknown Speaker  6:42  
going to talk through a couple of examples

Unknown Speaker  6:53  
so the first question I'm talking about here is the i 100. Program, which is a couple of program coverage mostly targeted around superfast broadband, but it's no really delivering fibers at the home gigabit broadband across the country, including rolling out subsea cables. For a number of additional islands, maps a combination of what was done to the last program and what's being done through government programs. So through this involvement, two key things we're going to talk about what is the open market review process? So while these programs start with the question of well, who has coverage and who doesn't have coverage for programs, so that means starting with a baseline, how do you find to find what the prices are in Scotland, which premises are valid for broadband delivery? That comes down to a lot of analysis with ordered so we address those things? With that we then go to the markets or broadband suppliers and gather information from there first to which premises they serve which premises they find to serve over a period of time. And through that process of cleaning, checking data combining it together, we come up with a view of unserved premises which are which are going to be done which are planned over a period of time and this is a complex process that can take a lot of time. Data quality from a lot of these companies, which vary in size and experience is quite challenging. So through that, we come up with a list of practices that are unsafe. We can use that for the basis of this procurements for for bidders basically tenders surface prices and other elements. Our work because cost modeling has got your government for for our imagined and other programs too. But we have some in house tools where we use information as information combined with equipment civil costs, your contractors to try and estimate the cost of serving those unsafe practices. And that helps to kind of wait for SEO ways. So the way we do that we pretty much we take the road network as a basis. We divvy the road up intensively into costs across countries we make a number of geo types to try and represent the cost and the difficulties of getting to different areas in the country. traditions we utilize use things to try different substances as we proceed through various segments we try to follow fiber on this route segments. There's a big network optimization that was analysis to try and try and produce an optimal model if you like that someone's gonna have said and worked on as also with that is clustering apprentices. We did quite a lot of density based clustering to try to look out where the optimal areas are likely to serve. And try to differentiate between clusters of between outliers, as all of that optimization has a huge effect on what your model cost is going to be. So that kind of information again, we present government across a number of scenarios and a number of different areas and all of that helps to sort of shape the procurement expectations in terms of budgets, and really map that cost and coverage curve understanding where you can get the best benefit from

Unknown Speaker  10:11  
some of the program, this time in the info program. So this is looking to deliver initially 55 locations to basically improve our coverage hotspots, as you'd imagine a lot of these are considered rural areas. So we were involved in a can lead to kind of initial project stages where we're trying to scope for what is the scale of the problem or where are these areas we went into basically set the scene. So we did a lot of analysis on all of our coverage, first contributions trust, combining everything about current coverage and where we can credit to coverage for areas. So that's the case we're getting information from Ofcom as to the existing plans, and then in terms of plant coverage, effected information on what the emergency services network where they have planned loss sites, which is going to be 4g based, a lot of cases go public. So we used to have to provide this information we use our own radio planning tools to get more specific coverage predictions which is the map is either at the top left to try and get this baseline what is the issue in Scotland in terms of premises of the rows of geographic coverage, where where are the issues or where's the phrase? And then we use that information to try and focus into specific areas for doing analysis in terms of NOC spot clusters. How do we prioritize and break these and how when we look at candidate site locations wherever you put them ask what's the benefit can be what the cost is going to be to deliver there. So that information was packaged together along with some some field survey data. So with a little bit fields JS data collection, was packaged together to to procure future stress around and that is now being rolled out by the bhp telecoms. So you may well benefit from an area program. One final aspect we're helping with at the moment too, and that's the map at the bottom here is we're also doing some assurance work. So once these masks have been deployed and services are there, how does the company delivery demonstrate that it is live and delivering what we've been doing some surveys afterwards? driven so many of our particular areas showing you showing the results and that helps me when it comes to

Unknown Speaker  12:35  
another example that. Steve earlier to this is a slightly different way we developed this proof of concept

Unknown Speaker  12:44  
to help monitor water levels. In the western US, this is in conjunction with Scott.

Unknown Speaker  12:55  
And in this case, we took this proof of concept pilot that's responsible for delivering it in its entirety. So from selecting equipment to configuring and deploying it to the data capture, processing and visualization. So what happened here we've got 10 Laura sensors measuring pressure effectively been calibrated for water. peatlands, we've also got a local weather station and that information is being captured brought back into the dashboard this is actually allows real time relative real time monitoring over a long period of time to try and see what's going on with the water levels. And you can see there are different colors, each of them tend to be fluctuating in relation. So I guess the key thing or benefit about this project is that traditionally, measuring this sort of thing was a very manual task. We have to go to the site on a regular basis. Instead here we've got sensors you can deploy, potentially up to 11 years of battery life changing sufficient via a low maintenance. Installation. And this as I say it's been around this for the next 12 months but hopefully we can capture a view pre restoration work particularly. Look fibers.

Unknown Speaker  14:11  
Actually slip, skip over the next contract keep us tied together. But if anyone wants to talk to us about the work that we did or MPB charge this Patrick's look at my time. We have got a few minutes for question answer.

Unknown Speaker  14:31  
Yeah, there is and what I would suggest is five minutes I wanted to give you time to do the question. So if anybody wants to pose a question on the north coast 500 or Eb, this is your time to do it, but I'm going to get out of their way. So has anybody got any questions they want to ask? Otherwise, I will ask them about the two things we stopped them from telling us about any questions

Unknown Speaker  0:00  
Are any batteries without anybody above the ground going What the hell is going on below? Unless the big hole of his there is a big hole in drum and demonic, which is the geo Observatory which was developed by BTS I was on board that was certain that went out goes down about half a kilometer at the minute it's like speaks like David that use it, but hopefully other people will be interested and the reason why glass was undermined because the mind shots went down out with the city boundary, and then they just followed the coal and coal doesn't go in straight lines. So you have 15 minutes and then five questions up to you.

Unknown Speaker  0:38  
Thank you very much. I was a bit reactive before I got here whether or not people would know what my what I do. But actually that's really important. So I thought I might have to spend the first few minutes at least giving you a little interest in what I'm talking about here. So my name is David balls. I'm a PhD researcher at Strathclyde University but I also work with Taganrog energy through our Scotland and there's not a huge demand in Scotland for renewable electricity anymore in terms of adding to the grid authority 98% renewable but there is a huge challenge in providing low carbon heating and the North Sea transition authority earlier. This is an example of having to switch from hydrocarbon based heating towards a lower carbon source. So what I'm going to talk about is one of the chapters in my PhD which is where I use GIS in a bit of a sort of baptism by fire, learn GIs at the same time is trying to run an analysis and put some quotes together to try to pitch towards like local authorities, landowners, developers, who've been have some say on and that's to use Mike water as a source. So to explain this, I've got a diagram here at the bottom left, which is kind of like your ideal line board geothermal system. So each of those colored bands beneath the surface are mined. And the theory is that you can move water through these coal mines if they're connected. So you have a series of overlapping coal seams. And you can abstract from one side red model here and you can reject you pass it through your energy station. Elsewhere into the coal mine and then it circulates back through and it always back up by the time you take it back out again. What this looks like in reality is a drill rig on site. This is where the Monday Tuesday Wednesday this week, we're drilling into coal mines. So the coal mines not restricted to Scotland. Obviously Wales and England have huge swathes of areas. Another piece of my PhD which I won't get into too much today is the two images on the right there and one of them is a map of the Midland valley of Scotland or the central belt of Scotland. And that's mapped out everywhere. I find where there's my water pouring out of the ground, and apparently poses a bit of environmental hazard as iron to the rivers if you've ever been to Dalkeith Country Park, you'll see the rivers orange, that's from this discharge here. Which by my calculations would give 2.5 megawatts of heating, which is about 602 major types of work currently just runs into the river and you lose that heat. So the whole theory is that you can take a little bit of the heat from the main water and use it and boost it up using a heat pump to provide district heating or cooling. Thank God for that. Now, let's talk about my case. Next slide. So, perhaps why do we actually want it? Well, it's it's a form of low carbon heating. Yes, there are other ones that air source heating, their their source, ocean source, biomass, these kind of things. Currently, low carbon heating sources in Scotland provide about 6% currently. So it's definitely one of those to consider going forward. What we get from my workings are high flow rates. So there's a place in East blue and black wealth treatment team, which pumps 300 liters every second, from the whole mindset, just to keep the water level suppressed so that these kind of discharges don't flow sizes and multiples, interrupt. liters per second. If you were to take or four degrees from that, then you're looking at something like six megawatts. So now we'll move on I mentioned earlier, your high flow rates, but you've also got constant temperatures. So because the mind markings are buffered from the surface by over many hundreds of meters of raw, the temperature stay constant all year round. Whereas if you're using an air source heat pump for your heating and cooling, then you're trying to fight the negative degrees perhaps over the Christmas holidays to heat your house and it all runs a little bit less efficient. But we're talking the same efficiencies in the middle of winter as we are. And as you can see, here are a lot of the cool areas in Scotland, central wealth overlap quite nicely with where the bulk of the population is. Next up next. So why do we need GIS to help us out here basically to understand and to portray to everybody else? Where is a good place to look for mine more? Because it's a bit of a daunting world to get started with. And often it needs experts involved. Excellent. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna have four criteria, which we've kind of come together as our research group to choose one of which is we want overlapping courses. We want them to be able to flow long enough to come back and retract having one that you want. No shallow seams, and this is what Julian alluded to earlier. With a substance race. We want that to be absolutely no risk that if we move water around in these mine workings, this stuff is going to start to fall in and so we've chosen mines that are deep enough, you can avoid these, which is needed. And so what we've been sort of traded here is a little diagram just to convey that if you've got mines that overlap, but you subtract the area which is shallow mines, and this is the kind of polygons you're going to be left with. So can you just click one more time? And this is what it looks like across the central belt of Scotland. So anywhere in pink is where there's only one main theme. Anywhere in the darker red is where we've got overlapping coal seeds. And this is already had any shallow seeds removed so they're not even showing. So that's kind of our criteria number one, which is going to go into our calculation later. On. When I have the next slide, please. A three, which makes the second map is all to do with the mind water level. So how deep beneath the surface does the water level rise to in the minds and all these sort of black circles, triangles and squares that are on this? Map are where I've taken data from whether that's me going around and looking at where these are discharging and controlling the water level or from the call authority having access to boreholes in Manchester and so that creates a nice sort of meters above ordnance datum surface level on the left, and then when you subtract it from your overly this one it gives you on the right and I've just kind of used the color scheme there to indicate where these are between the surface so anything between anything that's pink, sorry, in between surface and 20 meters below ground level, anything because blue is between 20 meters and 60 meters below ground level. Anything deeper than that, and you'd start to incur quite a high cost for pumping water out of the ground. Just going to find water which is going to cost so those are the reason why we've chosen those colors. The pink versus blue is a little bit more about having some issues perhaps with reinjection, in which case you might have a system slightly, but we won't get into that for now. Next slide please. And the final thing is finding a reasonable depth to drill to because the deeper you want to go, the more expensive it's going to be to drill to it. So it's a bit arbitrary, but somewhere in there, there's a cut off where we think we're gonna have a reasonable place to say okay, that's too deep. We don't want to spend that much money because we're trying to find the best sites here, not necessarily the only sites that will work. So every time we have experienced that if we go deeper than 250 meters, we're going to need a different drill rake, which is going to be more expensive to globalize, and they're not just going to overall make the product a little bit more expensive. So we've just decided to keep our minds that are shallower than 250 meters as the ones that are a Go ahead for us. Next slide please. Sorry to put a lot of text on the screen. But basically what we're doing now is saying okay, if criteria one and two, are there then assigned to one, they're not they're assigned to zero. So we need overlapping policies with no shallow workings. Criteria for which is the final one there. If this finds that are less than two meters assignment one, if they're deeper sign zero, the criteria three which is the color system or the main water level, that's going to stay so our color map is going to be the blues and pinks again. So one more click please. Now that's what we've created. We've got areas in Scotland, where there's overlapping coal seams, or there's no shallow seam. We've got drilled that visit within 250 meters on the surface, and we've got a ranking system based on how deep we have to go to pump mine. Next best place and so this is what we get here's the plan is to make this publicly available and open access and I had a bit of back and forth with the call authority in terms of getting permission to do that. In the end the agreement was the improvement service will host it for us and thank you very much for being a huge helping hand in organizing this. So it's all pretty much primed and ready to go. It's just a case of uploading it, farming it and then starting to make a big song and dance about this being probably the first.

Unknown Speaker  10:07  
So what it does is basically delivers it right to the doorstep of local authorities of people who are in charge of flooding, people who have housing developments and they want to look at low carbon heating sources, but also it saves the need for the experts writing this talk. So it means for free, you can go online and you can just check the area of looking at this feasible remind water geothermal without having to come to companies like all authority will often say can you give us a bit of money and we'll we'll do a feasibility study for you. It means you can already do that. And then you can come to the experts when you want to love them. Yeah, so let's say somebody right from the start and hopefully make some get some new more projects off the ground early. Thanks. I've zoomed in on a few of these. So this is North Lanarkshire council with the greatest coverage of places where I would highlight are optimal for minority of thermal. And then I've also added on each of those discharges which themselves have a heating potential so those are the little circles that are on there and they're kind of ranked by how much heat you could get out of this. So again, that's something that's I have an it'll be an appendix in the back of my PhD but it will be made available freely available for anyone to see. So overall, this will be held on the room service website for everyone's view, and I hope that many people will take me out for the offer of having a little scroll through. Next slide, please. So that's me. You can find more over time or energy or Strathclyde now have quite a big cohort about getting my mortgages. I'm off the ground. Look, now, LinkedIn, this is where I'll be sharing this probably most likely email addresses there. And I just wanted the final picture just to sort of convey my passion for geothermal energy, energy see, and that was last summer I cycled from Scotland all the way through Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, across to Spain in order to view as many geothermal sites as I did. And this was kind of the electorate, which is like a big 1.5 megawatt system in Spain. And this was sort of my equivalent PhD students studying at their site and giving me a tour. Thanks very much for your time.

Unknown Speaker  12:28  
I can actually see the potential of those using that kind of stuff because I'm going to shut up unless you want to go for it. We still run

Unknown Speaker  12:43  
so you're pumping. That's the tension that comes from just wondering what the the energy that you're getting from the temperature differences compared to potential that you're sort of what what's the energy to get out of that? In terms of melt? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:05  
So when I was pumping yesterday, on site in Newcastle, water was coming out of the ground about 18 degrees, which is relatively high for mine water, we expect somewhere between 12 and 14 or 16 degrees. You put that through a heat exchanger, and you have to be careful to avoid like iron over clogging. The heat exchanger will take whatever you decide four degrees out of the water so if it goes at 60 degrees, it'll come out the other side of the danger as well. And that's what you reinject elsewhere. You've now got four degrees to play with in your heat pump. And you can choose a heat pump, which is going to take that and boost it up to whatever temperature you desire. You've got a lot of new builds houses, for example, that might take 45 degrees. And that's going to be a lot more efficient than trying to retrofit it and boost up to 18 or older. But all in all, he comes to running and efficiencies CLPs of four, which is the coefficient of performance. So for every unit of electricity you're putting in, you're getting four units of thermal energy. So you've only taken four degrees from your mind out there, but you can boost it up to 4565 85.

Unknown Speaker  14:14  
I'm just gonna say reverse refrigeration is the key. So it's no refrigeration in Glasgow if you think about refrigerator takes the cold there and the back of the refrigerator is hot. What you're describing is reverse of that it's taking warmth and putting coal back out. So you can do one degree plus one degree plus one degree, one degree and keep going to get to 100 degrees if you want to. You can have 50 heat pumps while the CLI for instance we've calculated and not reduce the heat it's worth my workings, a really neat trick. You had your hand up.

Unknown Speaker  14:46  
Just how was your detailed discovery journey. So the data that you got from the call authority, for example, to build those models? I was just curious about how how accessible

Unknown Speaker  15:00  
it was a challenge. There was various points along that process which were challenged. I think I was drawn in some sort of special access when they gave me the entire suite of Scottish mind data. Previously they said I think maybe 10 by 10 kilometer is the limit for people in academia. So it was a bit more of a sales pitch to say look, I'm really trying to help the industry here. Please, can you give me more? And then yeah, but ended up being 10s of 1000s of polygons for the underwriting work and shapefiles and hundreds of 1000s of data points and yeah, it was a lot for my for local here. And sort of didn't help. I was never learning as I went. So it might not even work. I didn't know what I was doing. The directors a lot of trial and error. And then so I'm about the middle was actually sort of free of any issues from the full authority, but then at the end trying to publish something and they were happy with that was far enough removed from the original dataset was a real challenge.

Unknown Speaker  16:00  
Okay, thank you. sponsor. Question.

Unknown Speaker  16:03  
Yeah. So just just to find a point on that if anyone's interested in viewing this data David's been talking about if you search for the spatial web via Google search, you'll find it. And that should be available in the next few weeks. It's only going to be available as a CMS API. But it should allow you to look at it in the context of whatever you're looking at and make your own assessments.

Unknown Speaker  16:25  
Any more questions to know I'm going to take chairs privileges again and put one over there go for every spin run. So I'll have this like,

Unknown Speaker  16:34  
Wow, interesting so I'm

Unknown Speaker  16:39  
just doing what the developers

Unknown Speaker  16:51  
was.

Unknown Speaker  17:01  
Totally, I think the mandate for Scotland to move away from gas boilers and 2024 is watched in the

Unknown Speaker  17:13  
planning regulations changed at 9am on the 13th of February, the ship national planning framework that says that we should shift from gas powered heating to other sources. The issue we've got the minute is the UK regulation as the connections between the novel heating and the main set. So if you're trying to set up a district heating system at the minute, it's subject to regular values as if it was a business so that legislation is change. The house builders have taken nudge behavior. So we will as planners refuse their planning application unless they do alternative heating systems. So if you look in Glasgow at the minute they are being forced to look at Gold Standard from the bream rating which is forcing them to do that's a bit of a push pull, because if we build a very, very small house, where you can put hands that your geothermal losses are very, very small, because you're in a terrorist so they can meet some of those requirements without going to new forms of heating. But for the next five years, it will be a push and they will need the data because we will start with the evidence, which is well point them to the stuff that Simon's now hosting, because they'll need to give us the evidence for as planners will give them the evidence back to tell them that the cabin is a load of rubbish.

Unknown Speaker  18:38  
Developers and engage them

Unknown Speaker  18:46  
Yeah, I would add, I would add to that, the example he's loaded metagame for blank hosting site where there's upwards of six and beyond megawatts in the exact spot where blade Wells is being developed. And the developer there's just decided to close the ties because it's the usual property, whereas local authorities will be much more receptive to an open East loading pencil. I said, we know there's a huge resource here. We would ideally like developers to use it, but is there any way that we can use it? So is there a real sort of switch between

Unknown Speaker  19:25  
there is like a class good thing because we all built over a kind of mind working. We are looking at district heating heat from my work who we've worked with green space Scotland since Power Map if you haven't looked at that, they have out on it because that tells you where if we can't do it for hosting, we can at least grab the heat you can store it underneath the parks. create great space for the communities. They want to know that there's a heated heating system underneath the ground. That's great for education. They don't just think, Oh, it's great place to sit. And we did do talks with tenants, this brewery because they create the huge amount of heat. If we could capture that as well because sources there's lots of other things where heat is being generated as well as the heat from the ground, but the mind workings are huge potential drops. Actually.

Unknown Speaker  20:23  
I mean, in terms of cost per property, you obviously wouldn't install on our property, you'd be looking at perhaps a housing team of 200 houses or more before it starts. I think

Unknown Speaker  20:35  
the problem is that the minute the calculations based on the economy of just buying something and walking away, it's actually they're gonna have to start doing the carbon accounting and the carbon locking and the carbon locking costs of the amount of help they're not producing will make these efficient, but as long as they keep calculating on old fashioned economic things, then their viability argument will say it's not viable which is why the legislation is changing the pelvis with the proper liability. Sorry, but

Unknown Speaker  21:06  
a private landowner and file manager who lives right next to the time he wants to build houses, and all my 40s I will because that's part of his legacy is just slightly different in terms of developers are going to build it and by the way, sell them on and forget about it. So it's kind of there because it's a part of this legacy. That's why

Unknown Speaker  21:29  
I say if you want more conversation, grab favor the sessions. I will promise I won't because I know too I describe myself as a geo planner, when I was getting the victory of verbal, so thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  21:50  
EZRI lands on the Serbian thirst for sponsoring this bit of or introducing them as they go to they paid the most money. So thanks very much. They have deep pockets and the golden lesson is to come up with a platinum sponsor, in which case I apologize you're not the best in the world. But thank you for sponsoring this. We now have a very short break I think are we introducing another NOC code? They're coming up alright come up because you paid your money go sorry.

Unknown Speaker  22:30  
Why I'd say thanks, Julian. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  22:41  
It's my privilege to introduce our co sponsors this with us.

Unknown Speaker  22:55  
I'm Danny dark. I'm from the data lab Innovation Center. I'll do my usual thing is going to put your hand up compared to the days so we are one of seven innovation centers in Scotland funded by Soros funded government plans to raise some space near here are really our mission is to accelerate data science and AI across private and public sector. We are really focused on innovation projects where we can work with companies and academics to help develop components and services with a focus on that small data science team or they can work with these projects. We have a focus on skills because skills as we discussed today is a big issue. We fund NSC places that need to to this year we fund PhD placements in companies. We do CPD executive education for organizations, private and public sector that help and advice and build their data capabilities, data teams. We have an online community which helps the table I'd say you can join for free and that connected or professionals in Scotland and beyond. And instead to be in a couple of delegates, administrators and data scientists, March the 14th and come and talk to me about large international summit in November. So we are on the table all day. Happy to talk to eight justices.

Unknown Speaker  24:34  
Good morning. UK customer success manager and all things public sector resource Scotland. Firstly, I just like to take the opportunity to thank

Unknown Speaker  24:51  
for hosting facilitating today. And I'm very proud sponsor of AGI going forward. The other thing is, it's great to see so many people here today. You know, we've all been through the pandemic last AGI was an online event. I remember right. And see so many faces to be this great. And thank you again. See, we're all set up to zoom in

Unknown Speaker  25:22  
just a little about about as you probably know, as much as I do. We're 54 years old and on the internet with one site that was the customer proceeds on the survey being

Unknown Speaker  25:40  
Yeah, that's that's been reflected on us. Yeah, we were placed in 73 countries worldwide. 11 research and development centers across the globe. We're very proud that one of them was actually two miles up the road, where we employ roughly 40 to 50 staff in ESRI development. And our thing that we're very proud of, especially to the sort of economic climate is that we're still playing a role on revenues back into r&d going forward. So we're very keen to continue the progression of geospatial technology. Hopefully you enjoy the morning so far. There's lots more to come which is which will be interesting. But reduce thermal presentation was really good this morning, myself, I call it money, press over the back there, but you know, they put on a stand up site for this Yes. Thank you

Unknown Speaker  27:03  
Oh, so we are the new kids on the blog. My name is Andy Williams and I was a real formerly military service. That headed step child Ordnance Survey for runners for that. But thanks very much for for having us today. We are blessed in this country to have really really great things and for those of you who are GIS analysts in the room, you know how good it is and also how frustrating it is to try and put it all together. And when you stick together you can get so far, and then you need to process it. And then you can actually start to do some really interesting things with it might be really great if you whatever subject that is, I'm very happy to talk to anybody about anything. So if you've got some burning issues that relate to that sector that you work at, then please do come and talk to us when the origin of the companies that we use. We were created to find lands and all sorts of islands. But we've moved way, way beyond that. And we're looking at things now, such as where to put new ground source heat pumps, where to do social prescribing for people who have breathing difficulties, things can you identify the best places for these people to live? There's already different things you can do with the data. Basically what we do is we try to steal everything from everybody

Unknown Speaker  28:32  
so that's

Unknown Speaker  28:35  
a doughnut customers. I'm sick the manager but I'm also the national security sector manager for a very small sector. But it's back again to the AGI for a

Unknown Speaker  28:47  
moment and

Unknown Speaker  28:49  
just to say thank you very much for all fantastic presentations we've had to do to be put in. And ordinarily I'll give you an insight as to what the National Security Project does. But that'd be terrible career move as my boss and teaches special officers do presentation later today. So I won't be mentioning any of that. Please come on. To the presentation. See that. I will just say that we are on mass. We're showcasing a couple of things our National Geographic database, which is an acceleration of our data, reinforcement, encourage you to come speak to us about that. But also the ongoing story with us about our work from data and more data accessible to everyone. Most recent builds up dates as well. So please come out and chat to us. We've gotten to know folks but thanks very much.

Unknown Speaker  29:46  
To go back memories of one of the best. So I was involved with a different life. It's in all that data into GIS. They have a system before they never put into GIS which is a member show because obviously descriptive. We don't have to because we try the nice things

### note
Unknown Speaker  0:01  
Good morning, I was excited to learn that lunch has been sponsored by other Doc's as well.

Unknown Speaker  0:09  
So I'm here today to talk to you about, I guess, today's events and we'd like to talk to you about the contribution to geospatial meets resilience in health.

Unknown Speaker  0:23  
Because in so many ways, actually geospatial.

Unknown Speaker  0:27  
Efficient Data is the foundation upon which we can build that resilience and health. It's also a foundation. We can strengthen about which if we do I think make even greater and stronger contribution in future and make Scotland more resilient, stronger, and healthier nation.

Unknown Speaker  0:44  
So we're gonna approach this by talking to you about some of the assets we have. So the abilities that we have within our organizations. Some of the national data that we're able to access through public sector to social agreement, as well as the kind of location enabled health data that we bring together, organizations like mine bring together and then how we apply some of those assets. And I'm going to talk through some of the fantastic ways that his team has been able to do that is to create insights for anybody from data as well. And we're going to invite you to be part of that as well. So as a community, professional community, how can you help us answer the question, how can you help us to achieve that goal of making Scotland up stronger and healthier and future to that patient geospatial?

Unknown Speaker  1:34  
So my hypothesis is that NSS isn't actually terribly well known outside of health and I talk to you a little bit about who we are.

Unknown Speaker  1:44  
We're a national board, first of all national health board. So that means that we provide national services that we run things like the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, we do all that fantastic procurement that was so vital, actually, during the pandemic.

Unknown Speaker  1:59  
And we also provide a digital data security solutions through dahlias organization that I'm part of the NSS. And we have that portfolio of capabilities that we deploy to help our customers meet their needs. And then Scotland has the nation and the data pillar that I lead. Actually, it's the National Institute for Health and Social Care in Scotland. We provide that core capability to integrate, organize, manage, and report on data from across the health service. And we've worked really, really close to internal structure the fact that we are pretty pretty closely with Public Health Scotland as well as others like Matt, it's important to territorial boards to achieve.

Unknown Speaker  2:41  
So we really recognized our health and social care data is a is a national asset. To us. It's a national asset. And we manage that asset on behalf of citizens and the health service to support over 4000 users across health care, across government, academia and the public to derive value and insight from the data we produce. Today over 150 data products to do that. The data that we work with actually spans not just clinical data and clinical data about our workforce and financing documents are important. And those natural assets do play a vital role in Scotland's health informatics.

Unknown Speaker  3:20  
Developing research, unfortunately, will require skilled people across the world

Unknown Speaker  3:35  
to talk about words, the examples about how we've actually applied all of that use cases that supported solid resilience. But ultimately, these products support both public health professionals and policymakers as well as those public facing efforts. As I said, the public has gotten delivers to make better decisions to empower people make some really passive decisions and policy makers as we saw, be really clear and for example

Unknown Speaker  4:04  
so everybody noticed that that was Scottish. Government.

Unknown Speaker  5:56  
Your specialization analytics to be taken?

Unknown Speaker  6:01  
No know.

Unknown Speaker  6:03  
All that fantastic. Technology is great, but as I say, we need access to really high quality data. The next piece of the picture is the access to that that National Geospatial data and services public sector geospatial agreement is really important really important.

Unknown Speaker  6:21  
agreement between Scottish Government and Cabinet Office enables the PSG public bodies and Scotland to access premium detailed coordinates so that essentially MasterMap topography layer, address base by way of 3d space as long as it provides access to a number of web services to value assets, that ultimately enables easier sharing of data that does tremendous asset enables data access, collaboration, data sharing, and sharing the analysis. That's a really important thing as well. It takes away a lot of licensing problems as well as access to it.

Unknown Speaker  7:05  
So I'm going to be talking a bit about technology both in our teams and thankfully we have to talk about public health and some of the use cases of it's actually applying that to

Unknown Speaker  7:21  
romped So, public health geology, we're a relatively new organization. Formed in April of 2020. The timing of which was, let's say interesting, given what happened a month earlier.

Unknown Speaker  7:40  
Essentially, we were coming together three pre existing NHS organisations Health Scotland and health protection Scotland, kind of get a quick show of hands to see if anyone has heard any of these three.

Unknown Speaker  7:58  
Now we're gonna get a quick turn around to see who's heard Public Health Scotland

Unknown Speaker  8:08  
so, before we go and come together these three organizations to meet the three core pillars of population care, health protection.

Unknown Speaker  8:21  
So when it comes to use cases for spatial spatial health traditionally have been somewhat under utilized. However, looking back over the past couple years, some have changed. And again, because of the pandemic we were able to very quickly utilize spatial information to help policy also, rapidly because I mean, for example, when we went into pandemic, I'm pretty sure a lot of you wouldn't see a public facing dashboard for reporting. That was all based around spatial. We use Azure web apps to allow us to move quickly to put out into the public. Also, what you can see here, we were able to overlay and blend a lot of information about settings about things like Google mobility, data, about incidents, put that all together temporarily and then give that to policymakers give that to people that needed that information, to be able to very quickly and clearly make decisions that they wouldn't have necessarily been able to do at the data we've presented traditionally.

Unknown Speaker  9:43  
And then moving on from that. We go into a period where we start looking at vaccination, we were able to utilize spatial information around this better ensure that places are located correctly JCVI cohorts were created to essentially pinpoint at risk vulnerable groups. And right we were able to then ensure that things like the supersenses we're capturing suitable percentages of those at risk and make sure they could be suitably vaccinated.

Unknown Speaker  10:22  
So that was looking backwards a little bit. We look forwards now to what we're doing. Also interesting. To mention during the COVID side of things. It was pretty much me and one other person working on a lot of spatial stuff centrally. We now we've got 14 Anything that means it's not just me because we've got far more capacity to do a whole lot more.

Unknown Speaker  10:50  
Looking forwards. We're now working on a project as a team that is part of NHS ashore and that's coming from national services Scotland and in response to the climate emergency sustainability strategy. We need to see where all of our locations are across the piece, not just in the territorial booth but also looking at special health books too. So that's things like National services, Scottish ambulance service, so on so forth. We're leveraging the use of the PSTA data that Albert mentioned. And off the back of some work that ESRI and NHS vice have done. We've used that as a template to move forward and create something at a national level, whereby we're going to get that point information for each of these sites. We're then subsequently going to get the redline data either from our state or getting that from registers of Scotland so we don't have those expensive those properties captured accurately.

Unknown Speaker  12:01  
Of off the back of that.

Unknown Speaker  12:03  
We're creating buffers around them.

Unknown Speaker  12:06  
Then we're populating those buffers feeds information from PSTA. So we're utilizing the breeze base layer we're utilizing MasterMap topography and then using ESRI suite application, we're able to consume all of that information that's put together and produce accurate land use that can be utilized more widely.

Unknown Speaker  12:31  
This is fantastic for the sustainability. side of things. But this also has huge application more widely for help, because we have this rich, detailed picture of exactly where everything is. And yeah, I think I'm really really excited about where this project is going to leak.

Unknown Speaker  12:52  
And with that I'm just going to hand back over to Albert

Unknown Speaker  13:01  
you know what, we've got some great technology, great data. We've got fantastic skills of people I can team and I think those examples illustrate just the kind of impact that contribution of geospatial can make Scotland stronger nation. So all those things together they open the door and map as as offline experiences. It was the pandemic has opened the door to that conversation so something about how do we build on that as a profession? How do we make sure that we can have an even greater impact and bring forward those use cases and and you know, thinking about this, how do we make that that foundation How do we grow it I think there's something about helping to promote that understanding of the opportunity and the applications of geospatial right. And to try and do that in a way that it demystifies the language around these technologies around us professionals around this space so that decision makers and policy makers, first of all, feel that they can interact with them interact with professionals and know how they can engage us and what questions to ask them to get the answers they need.

Unknown Speaker  14:11  
I think the second thing that we wasn't thinking about is how do we suddenly about how we democratize more spatial so that we do have the professional skills to bear the most challenging problems. We enable more people to interact with geospatial technologies get value from geospatial and see really senior decision makers directly interact with these kind of solutions to get insight to help support the decisions.

Unknown Speaker  14:38  
Secondary release around how we apply our skills to ensure that we enjoy the highest possible levels of trust from those we serve because I think there's something around for me anyway, there's always the ethics of how we apply data and in really mindful about that and having that front of mind wherever whenever we're doing certain something.

Unknown Speaker  15:02  
Work with Andy during during the pandemic that was problematic for public health professionals continued to pervade our work, particularly dealing with data about people I mentioned, I want to be really clear about the shared champions as much as they offered for those of us who work within the health sector. I think the challenges are brutal. But I think if we can work on those if we address them, there's no question whatsoever that geospatial can have an even greater impact in future I think it's just scratching the surface of the potential so I think it's good. There's no question whatsoever that we can make our health service and Scotland even more effective, to be more resilient, and ultimately, help save time in their lives. Thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  15:53  
Okay, we've got a few minutes for questions. You have any questions?

Unknown Speaker  15:58  
microphones in the room so

Unknown Speaker  16:06  
sorry, this hate planner here but it's probably going to help the green space map you're using for both Ordnance Survey came out of work the green space Scotland did with the bench to authorities to create our open space map. That's a quantity map because they were authorities in new guidance going out trying to get the quality data behind that open space. So whilst you're pulling that data for the quantity, please come to work with the counselors of the quality. Some of that is about the functionality of the open spaces across those communities, but lots of different uses. There's lots of different demands. Whilst you might be prescribing somebody goes for a walk. Where's Council planners might be trying to fight to keep that space because we're being told it's financial burden. And I'll give you an example from Chapel just very quickly in stand beside Drumchapel Park and this is Social Work buildings one on the right from chapel there is bricks and mortar economic reasons why they say that social work thing can be replaced. But we're being told that the purpose of financial liability even though it is saving lives, but we can't get your data to say that it's saving lives and we can't do the cause and effect we've tried. We've done a bit of people don't understand.

Unknown Speaker  17:22  
But there is a huge potential for Public Health Scotland to work the council's to look at the data and split that data and understand it. I've moved from just the quantity to the quality and it's the quality data that's important that lived experience of the communities and understanding hate and open up your asset to the wider communities. Hence why there's a children's play park at what was the southern general that has no boundaries around it because I argued it was a political community park as well.

Unknown Speaker  17:56  
Just just just one that I completely agree it's very plain. It's also a good example of the importance and impact of geospatial

Unknown Speaker  18:04  
geospatial disclosure, government integrate collaboration across the public sector and build out assets. So that's a great point. Well, just because I'm here ultimately having spaces where people come together to collaborate about some of this data, particularly when it is sensitive.

Unknown Speaker  18:25  
Sensitive, that are secure, but nevertheless, if we can bring people into to collaborate on what some of these sentences are invested in co2, right, so deliver that hopefully we can start to work on some of these questions and Absolutely.

Unknown Speaker  18:43  
If people have any, any other questions

Unknown Speaker  18:51  
probably having worked on your own as a one man band for Mr. COVID. Well done.

Unknown Speaker  18:58  
Now, I want to caveat that we did have help we work collaboratively with the Scottish Government teams as well where we could, but my question really is and you said before, easy was it to get the skills you required and to build it? And is it stuff that people you still having issues with what the challenge is really up in that space? It's not the easiest jobs, I'll put it like that. We have had to grow a lot of our own and there are stupid unfortunate that when we have people coming into the organization, we're able to cherry pick those candidates that do have relevant skills or show that sort of enthusiasm in that area. So we're able to somewhat get the right staff, but not always from the get go. And that has been a fairly significant he tried to do exercise internally to get those staff up to speed.

Unknown Speaker  19:56  
Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  20:04  
could you tell us how did you find recipients and how to measure risk?

Unknown Speaker  20:15  
Sorry, I guess it depends on the space in which we are thinking about them. So I guess resilience is probably about the organisms for our services. And you can see that just in the context of the crisis and our ability to move people through health services in a way that is inefficient, providing effective health care. We could also see it in the context of public health emergencies and trying to think about some of the examples and talking about the ability of health services to respond to those kinds of incidents, those kinds of events, continue to provide continuity of service and continue to care. And this is really at the heart of resilience is does that address the question?

Unknown Speaker  20:57  
Let's do that.

Unknown Speaker  21:01  
Lot of conversations happening after

Unknown Speaker  21:08  
thinking about future pandemics and the likelihood of avian influenza becoming a big issue in the near future are you doing much work with animal health specialists to share data and your thinking around resilience score for that potential issue on the horizon?

Unknown Speaker  21:34  
So the short answer that is neither of us are epidemiologists. So we cannot answer that question.

Unknown Speaker  21:53  
Thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  22:07  
Consultant and your patient intelligence agency.

Unknown Speaker  22:11

Unknown Speaker  22:43  
A principal consultant

Unknown Speaker  22:50  
says thank you very much for inviting me to talk to you today. What we're talking about is how we've been using the data that we have, specifically location intelligence data, to help our clients and the organizations that we work with, to understand the implications of the cost of living crisis.

Unknown Speaker  23:19  
Right, so just quickly introduce who we obviously ACI, and one of our principal data sets, I'm gonna be talking about how we've been using that, to understand the cost of living crisis specifically with location and really what people are telling us or what consumers are saying and how

### note

Unknown Speaker  0:00  
In which groups are more vulnerable, it's about identifying compromising. And a lot of the size of giving are similar to ones in Scotland's recently where the focus was on child poverty

Unknown Speaker  0:20  
So, feel CCI is the big downfall of asking somebody in your marketing department in your slides that

Unknown Speaker  0:34  
I'm speaking to you from the locations and specifically women within the communities of governments.

Unknown Speaker  0:52  
Governments and associated and organizations really to help them understand provides demographic location intelligence and consumer data. And that might be using mobile data combined with with other datasets in my city of Westminster to understand how souls recovering after the pandemic and understand how they can help local businesses with regenerative oil might be about overloading, population segmentation and consumer segmentation datasets to start to to help understand security stability and also about the engagements but how you can use

Unknown Speaker  1:31  
it delivery of your policies. Maybe it's one of the ways in which Bread Butter in the

Unknown Speaker  1:49  
US maybe

Unknown Speaker  2:07  
the most effective Oh no. This has been free put your hands pretty much

Unknown Speaker  2:23  
before this is your sign similar demographic or social statuses

Unknown Speaker  2:29  
and it's about providing sufficient

Unknown Speaker  2:36  
justification for what we find when we ask people to test various means on the website. You can put your own postcode in a country is people say, Well, that doesn't describe me but it describes my neighbors these are people who have

Unknown Speaker  3:00  
degrees

Unknown Speaker  3:13  
means etc. So it should give you a guide to who these people who've been able to sell without us only leaving you too much insight into making decisions. On a specific level, we can identify similarities and differences really, district levels this example we've got two postcodes couple streets away, broadly similar from an Irish point of view. But actually when you look at things like income housing type 10 yet very different and stress when you do understand those two different types of communities will have different needs different requirements and different levels of resilience. Speaking as I say, we've been looking at things on the axis in terms of age and afterwards, but actually, mostly talking about child policy is an example here. We can do the same thing. We've got the group by again by income, but they're also likely to have children that if we're looking at a vulnerable groups are particularly prone to charcoal teeth and we can focus in on that top left hand corner and we can see them we've got Dr. Campbell, you're more likely to find families in more situations. So it's very effective. As a targeting tool. Understanding where it's at.

Unknown Speaker  4:31  
Confined and that's okay, so

Unknown Speaker  4:39  
we've all we're all living this, we've all experienced this 24 hour rolling news agenda telling us what was going on. It's not

Unknown Speaker  4:57  
quite what we actually want mentioned recently this is another pandemic

Unknown Speaker  5:13  
where is that happening? Specifically, where should we

Unknown Speaker  5:25  
go you've got a lot of public information, quite high level, high level and as we see it it's also a national national number. This is kind of what's happened in the past. In the future, when we do see forecasts, inflation forecasts, I'd be able to send us any public announcements and we say so you might have to get capital maybe Charles has been talking about having there's also a lot of important work, such as think tanks are doing. But again, they played with oceans in the mornings when they try and make the rest of the national media. So they're not going to have any customers. We've been trying to fill gaps in new formats we've been doing consumer attitudes. Transaction doesn't I would imagine changing the way of transacting.

Unknown Speaker  6:40  
displayed information on our website. We have various sources including just

Unknown Speaker  6:52  
surveys

Unknown Speaker  6:57  
how to translate customer sentiment,

Unknown Speaker  6:59  
but he wasn't talking about the transaction those are things to trust and see when a country's banking transaction transactions I mean cell phones especially transmit how people are moving

Unknown Speaker  7:25  
stuff from the US I know what you're thinking, what are the rest of the stuff

Unknown Speaker  7:45  
we also see transactions despite the cost. Average transaction value is going down. So what's that mean? What's

Unknown Speaker  8:05  
the best way to stop that yourself rather than buying like random things depending on whether or not all the same from from March. The latest surveys different moments

Unknown Speaker  8:37  
and things like

Unknown Speaker  8:43  
that. Morning trends out of extreme using small luxuries and tricks on the victim

Unknown Speaker  9:18  
when he starts

Unknown Speaker  9:26  
that's that's interesting, but it doesn't necessarily matter too much for us to decide what fate is against

Unknown Speaker  9:41  
by older, more important to

Unknown Speaker  9:53  
ramp up much closer people. If you could use my app when you start we're going to see some interesting permissions MCQ.

Unknown Speaker  10:17  
worrying trends that show and then probably the most stark all 20 people are saying that they've got to use a food bank, bus etc in the past and one in 10 It's a little bit less than that. Now it's about conceptual, really clear how that concern feeds down through the UI so down the bottom. So interestingly from point of view, the lowest evaluation that's nearly half the national average, but nevertheless, present some simply original copies as well as at the forefront of people's minds. So that's a bit about what people are thinking. Now I want to talk to you a bit about how we can understand who and where we're going to see the impacts or

Unknown Speaker  11:06  
so today I want to talk to you about another product

Unknown Speaker  11:09  
called disposable income. Now this is another postcode level tool, which allows us to estimate both gross disposable and net disposable income.

Unknown Speaker  11:25  
So once we understand overall net income, we can start to take out some of the the non negotiable costs work so they may be things like contract insurance, could be living costs, mortgage rent, and then things like council tax, utilities, water, whatever it may be essential food and clothing, journey to work childcare, all the different components of life and things that come out of your your bank statement. Every month, we decided to understand the different levels of those. And the key thing is because it's a postcode level, we can overlay that with people and start to understand what which groups are already struggling from, from a point of view of disposable income. And then we just started turning the dial. So what happens if you send food inflation at 17%? Whatever it used to be, generally we do update it once a year but actually we have to do a meteor update in October November because it was already too late. So we have we built in the flexibility to allow us to do that. But also what it allows us to do is on a salary basis as I say stuff stuff. So we see interesting devices, which sounds lovely, because their living costs, rents and stuff are so high, they're already struggling from disposable income point of view. So actually, as things change, is that roofing can be impacted, but then clearly the less affluent. younger groups with lower overall incomes are already squeezed in any change in some of these components are going to have a more dramatic effect. But you can actually see that from our most recent scenario, which we are you starting to say that things are running at about 17% interest rate rises by doing something ourselves. You can see how the different levels of changing on stable income just just less than 10% overall on average, the average disposable income is about 18,000. So clearly, danger averages very very different levels of customer profitability. rising and rising energy prices obviously we just 111 So we were able to use this during autumn last year when the energy crisis was I think really biting to start to understand Right. Right. Okay, so understand what which is gonna be most impacted by changes in in advice. So, right about October when before the price cap came in January where there was some suggestions that prices are going to 6000 pounds per household, whatever it may be, broadly speaking, what you're looking at is more rare to see that more dramatically impacts on that on that group. But allow us to say okay, well what happens with the price cap, when that sort of 1000 pound price cap came in? How does that how does that help people you can see up on the right hand side that why by no means is fix the problem has made it a little bit in other words, you can't really certainly did didn't help them.

Unknown Speaker  14:36  
Still significant problems to consider

Unknown Speaker  14:41  
going back to that scenario equalize more madness reminded amongst you might be wondering, you're talking about this happening pack bag, you've got variations on the other one. So it's pretty scenarios where we're actually trying to think about how incomes might be going up, have salaries might be going up wage inflation, but what we've what we've realized in this one in this version one is a little bit more dramatic is what what wage inflation there may be, of course, it's only once a year, whereas the changes that we're talking about 17% food inflation, think that this is what's happening on a daily or weekly basis on a monthly basis. Everything's changing. This afternoon. What we decided to do was to take income out of our scenarios. As you this is kind of what people are seeing happening as the bills come through the door every month is it working so that's why it's a little bit more dramatic. Finally, I got a map right? Obviously, because we can track this postcode running and we can see how that varies geographically, so map it out across Scotland. It's not just the urban areas that the most most everywhere gets affected. And you'll see some districts with much higher impacts whereas the average drop might be about 50 pounds, which will be very careful that averages as we just just talked about, and allows us to driven much more locally as a sense of postcode level so we can map the impact of those changes in the very local neighborhood level. You can see how the different variations on how that's affecting us. We can isolate areas with the very highest impact of child poverty about how we can blend data together. If we start to overlay that with areas where the number of households with children more than two times the national average for the subsidy has further we can start to say focus on specific areas where there's going to be higher or lower levels of resilience to the changes that we've seen and map to that map that out across Scotland to show 33,000 households and this might be impacting in these sorts of areas. I'd say. Yeah, I think just firstly, I've rattled through this and so thank you for bearing with me. I think the core message of what we're what we're saying is that until you understand what the who the where is being impacted you It's an event that you can start to take the actions to start to understand what happened we help people mitigate the impact of this of how you help people build, build, build resilience. Clearly, you've all got your own data sources. Hope that we've encouraged you to be using those in conjunction with other data sources that may be able to be useful to you to help you understand when to use and start to tailor the information you've gotten to start to really help target areas in need before them before that need. arises.

Unknown Speaker  17:59  
You have any questions?

Unknown Speaker  18:06  
Thank you very much for this insightful presentation. I would like to your living places, understand how.

Unknown Speaker  18:22  
More system video, understanding the world you can visit them by looking at your mutual document. It's all about that approach. It will be about using datasets such such as this probably

Unknown Speaker  18:43  
won't be blends. That sort of sounds to come through the points of well being we do have a

Unknown Speaker  18:55  
motion mentor, one of these

Unknown Speaker  19:01  
sorts of things like health needs and so good at the latest impacts without necessarily

Unknown Speaker  19:15  
so just a question regarding the prepaid vouchers that were given for customers that had prepaid gas electricity meters with a high percentage that didn't take any of the advantages. Is that data that you've gotten access to when you could do some analysis on that?

Unknown Speaker  19:37  
We wouldn't we wouldn't have that. I think is that available then? Yeah, that's fascinating to see. Actually. Yeah. How, which of these groups? Are we within the groups the types are more likely to take notes, which aren't is a big one. If you don't understand who's not taking them, and he's got to understand why and start to target those activities to help people engage with other things

Unknown Speaker  20:07  
for example, you

Unknown Speaker  20:14  
I'm gonna ask a question because I happen to hold the microphone. Very interesting talking to James and it really shows what you can do with with data, wearing my academic I guess I have a slight concern you should have come up there and said it was these variants we've got a target Dalek said extent you have uncertainty attached to these because it'd be very unfortunate if a local authority exactly word to say oh, these days we're going to target and ignore other areas where there may be equal problems but they're just on the margins. Yeah, great question. I think I think what, what we always say to this is we're trying to get the right balance between a one size fits all strategy and then using datasets like this to help target but not necessarily not necessarily isolates the wrong word. And I hope you get what I'm trying to do. I wouldn't in a slide like that advocate, but that would be the only place that you should be targeting such initiatives on the job, obviously one of the maybe you're absolutely right there. are always be both places on the margin number of things. It's about understanding, where's the highest priority and then move to move down there? Somewhere I think this would be a question in the wider conversation about accuracy of these sorts of datasets.

Unknown Speaker  21:38  
This is about targeting prioritizing rather than necessarily

### note
Unknown Speaker  0:02  
Property campaign. But basically if your property is driven by household income versus cost, and energy cost can be thought of as the amount of consumption of energy versus the unit price of the energy. And the amount of money that households have to spend on fuel is driven by how much money they have to spend on other things. All of the stuff that we've just heard about to poverty is driving fuel poverty, as other costs increase you have less money to pay for fuel incomes.

Unknown Speaker  0:41  
Surprised by that definition, government, governments are less straightforward. And one of the reasons why our work was England is because in the UK, we currently have two slightly different definitions of your property. And these definitions are part of that data infrastructure that are standard, right. So they are one of the things one of the kind of foundational infrastructure the Scottish definition, which is the find the Scottish fuel Property Act is more generous in the English definition. And it's a little bit simpler. The English definition says that you can only be in fuel. If you're in a house that has an energy race that you feel Scotland can move in any sort of house.

Unknown Speaker  1:38  
So we wanted to think about the challenges in the space. And I think our research has shown that the base or infrastructure for fuel quality needs to improve that, firstly, back definitions is really important, because definitions kind of set the standard there where everyone is working towards. And the UK government's definition isn't consistent. And it means that it's really hard to take a kind of consistent measure across the UK. In England, anyone living in a reasonably modern house can't be appealed. That means that it's becomes really hard for local support organizations to target support for those households. A lot of the official indicators that are then used by government to decide who is into your property. I would say a lot of those indicators come from things like census or any done every 10 years. I know we've just had around your census in England so we've got both. We didn't 18 months ago. Based on the extent to which the steams offer support to people is really patchy. We discovered in our research. So yes, there is a there are support grants available, but it's really hard for events for receiving their revenue. And we also found that there are really significant differences in quality of beta, particularly in Scotland. And some of the local revenue authorities.

Unknown Speaker  3:23  
But what I decided to do was bearing in mind all of these issues which we decided that we were trying to bring as consistent set of Asian nations together as possible to be able to take a consistent view of your policy across the country. Mind rescanned reflection of about 14 open datasets from central government that men do reporting basically metropix To understand the kind of climates in different parts of the country. We use those 40 data sets are a series of fuel property related measures. And I think we ended up with about 30 measures that were built out of those. Use those measures to come up with scores and those scores drawn all those kind of interrelated factors and they let us provide an indicator of poverty rates. And then we combine all of those disks for what's to come up with an overall fuel poverty risk score for every local authority and the ones that show in the next slide, a map so, the map shows who is affected by fuel using our index, fuel poverty rates, and perhaps unsurprisingly, it's the urban disadvantage areas that are most effective. And we found that to be quite reassuring, reassuring finding because it's what we expect most the most risk of your quality of life and I think the reasons for that were, it's an area of large numbers, families with low average incomes. There are a large number of families taking universal credits, and also 73 cents weddings in Blackboard are classed as energy inefficient, so below that magic safe threshold. The next slide. This was interesting. When the team started to do this research they expected the people who will be at risk of poverty would be the elderly instead advantage for all our research show very quickly was actually the people that were bad students, which I think is kind of tacky, actually. That the groups that were impacted work students. We also found that family strongly impacted typically families living in rented properties, or home parents actually found a difference between public sector rented properties and private sector rental properties and private sector rental properties are more severely impacted and we think that is because of the lack of controls.

Unknown Speaker  6:33  
It's one of the things that happens kind of standardized index that allows us to do with support, understand where the support was properly targeted, and actually how they chose a really positive correlation between the provision of support and grants and support from government against the kind of risk of your quality of life done with a combination, but there is room for improvement. So we think that local authorities in some local areas aren't getting the right allocations. of support. So there are some writing parties that have songs that are in greatest need may not be fully aware of what's available. And that comes back to the question about the credits. And we don't think those credits are working effectively. We definitely are aware of it.

Unknown Speaker  7:37  
Also, I think we all probably read in the media, things like the winter fuel payments for elderly people. They're not particularly a targeted way of getting support. So after that.

Unknown Speaker  8:01  
I think our research shows that fuel poverty disproportionately in brackets is taken pro barriers, people supporting Portland toxic waste. In the report, considering the demand for fuel policy in the businesses pay does give a good indication of because some of the results were the results that the research is expensive.

Unknown Speaker  8:30  
But actually the differences in the data infrastructure than the standards that are available in the scriptures and public bodies, the consistency of data about grants and support payments are really hard.

Unknown Speaker  8:45  
I think you might find more about our research. All of the information is on the OPI website. You can

Unknown Speaker  8:52  
find it very quickly. We've got the reports from their economics, it's a good read. Say to explore any local authority area, they rarely see the overall secure quality of this value explorer, the measures that indicate that so I think there's a question for you gets there that how do you prevent local authorities who have missed this target things which in their area or business notes because we made all the measures they wouldn't stop. It has a particular risk score. And then we've also published that data catalog. And in the data catalog, we list the 40 datasets that have been used to produce the analysis of where they come from n equals n we have our license. We list the 30 measures that were built from those datasets. And we talk about how we've created those measures and we talked about measures. And then we actually provide scores as well. And all of this data is available as an explorer report. Actually we see this as being valuable to countries

Unknown Speaker  10:06  
or infrastructure

Unknown Speaker  10:10  
products that we have produced to make it much easier for people to access.

Unknown Speaker  10:39  
And I appreciate this is probably the main question. So you didn't undertake them search yourself. But I mean, obviously one of the things you highlighted here was the difference in definition between convenience retailing, when versus Scotland versus both nations and I wondered if it has been considered or it might be something that follows on looking at you know, how those definitions exclude certain groups, you know, potentially as a means of challenging those definitions in terms of policy,

Unknown Speaker  11:12  
right? Yeah, we do talk about that in the research. We're not gonna be able to change government policy. But that research has been used to do the discussions with the governments of the UK about how people considered we have quite limited resources for the world, which meant we didn't have time to produce the fuel quality index into different nations considering the different definitions and data available. So that's why we have to focus on England transpiration record that we bring more data in and then we track record system in that ODI has is planning to repeat its research this year. So you can start to see funds. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  12:03  
We've got time for one more question

Unknown Speaker  12:12  
just to connect the two biggest presentations together and talk about proprietary data looking at these issues, and we're going to talk about open data. We've got a suite of 40 open datasets. I'm quite sure if we could make more access to the kaki data then we will find even more insight now. Surely there's a cool lab first of all over geospatial commission to put his hands into its pockets and perhaps fund the sharing of proprietary data like that with public sector so that at least we can get to that rich insight where we need at that geographic level

Unknown Speaker  12:48  
to to really make a difference. It's interesting. I really enjoyed the company, because like, I came to similar conclusions with proprietary data, and I really liked the privilege of using it. They came to the same conclusions that you know proprietary data.

Unknown Speaker  13:09  
So you a much finer level of detail on different levels of government policymaking. Our work is probably good enough for lots of use cases. But when you find an area or an area that's at risk than their breakfast, Councilman, but yeah, I mean

Unknown Speaker  13:46  
as I run their business.

Unknown Speaker  14:16  
Petition works for the national records of Scotland in Scotland

Unknown Speaker  14:35  
thanks so much. And yeah Also, the last slot from lunch, so it's quite some time. So thanks for making us a census. And I'm sure many of you are in Scotland. It was relatively recently last year we're able to census and census generally every 10 years but as you mentioned in the talks and some changes to plans so instead of 2021 census was carried out today was about the same as a sort of a background on where we are now. Election. Some of our clients, it's the geography funds as well. So I'm interested to just skip that. So my background on the Census obviously the census collects information on everyone in Scotland on the third of March but I wasn't sure when remembers it and remember, no no more importantly, given it was a legal requirement. So yeah, that takes off from activities. And it's not just the senses that we do we have the senses which are commercial what was

## Scotland’s Census 2022


### note
Unknown Speaker  0:00  
Not just helps us change the game by anyone who made a big mess during the census. So we don't click here and where we are now is and some things we've been talking about since modern census. And what we mean by that is a couple things, namely that it was primarily conducted an online survey where most of the funds were paper returns. 90% of the refunds we received were through the online condition to their users. We sent a letter with instructions on how to complete but there were N paper copies as well for those who wished. And it also talks about the methods that we use so for friends who are using more than half of one censuses. And so we're working with a range of different data sets within DWP and NHS er to help us up to date. So I won't say the census consensus coverage said and survey we recently included in the census to ensure that we produce a robust MSA and a common core Scotland's produces high quality results for our users. So we're working a lot internally and we have set up external review groups as well. So we have an international student group, which has experts in census coverage in the Ministry of Finance. And if anyone is interested in methodology, we do publish papers on our website. So they're covered minutes of meetings. I would go into detail but understand the what the most myself it's pretty complicated stuff. So we're about at the moment is proposes in the aftermath team who work on statistical disclosure control nodes, we're starting to get our plans together because obviously witness etc did published we want to make sure that we're quick to publish the results as it can be, and what we publish new issues and needs. So since its massive program, and we put out lots of reviews, it was a census there. So we want to make sure that whatever we produce meets that users instead of providing value and maximizing the potential of the census, so on that work with kind of consultation lately. So this was our chance to share plans with users and publishing census data over the years, so stick with me well for the 11 reasons yours in the next census, so based on Photoshop funds, and we said we're going to use compasses. So we asked about things, including the author and sequencing of topics and publish the tools that we will use, obviously, the geographical areas are published that changes the sense of patients and research and what users need from new questions. So it's going to be they've introduced a number of new questions including sexual orientation trans status or history up on veterans pushes on UK unfortunately veterans and the key Passport, passport in general. So we've got a lot of new information there and people are really looking forward to get to use that and we're trying to gather hope people are going to use that so that we can make sure what we published recently. So we recently completed a consultation that launched the toolbar, and a couple weeks ago, they had a global response. We had over 130 questionnaires that came from private sector, sector academic organizations and videos so we're taking our feedback and we're looking at appliance and Rock Paper and based on this, and we'll publish a report on our website, which will have more of the findings. I was gonna say the people who are interested us may not know about it. So I think the slides have been set out there are links to the consultation office that you can respond to as as much as you want. And so moving on to a picture the schedule. So this is the date and font option the other option and we don't have all paintings there at the moment. So we are working to get our digital payments for all these products. And that is taken into account. So the feedback we've got from users shouldn't use a consultation so we're asking them what they need, and we should publish it. But generally we're looking to publish a you'd have to declare activities which you could census instances coverage surveys this year. Initially rounded carrots by 86 Will portfolio level and then following that our staff who publish the under investments and once we started publishing on revenue estimates, they will tend to

Unknown Speaker  4:55  
split up our release schedule into phases. And this is just to help users understand what will be published in my chart up so I mentioned first couple releases will focus on population and household counts. Unfortunately, firstly, hopefully shouldn't be rented gets the second publication of younger kids by single use page six. So count by Hudson size or for those bits will publish for every geography we have that area and also publish some information on those resident in Scotland by whether we were living in a household or a homeless option. last about a minute phase two which is where we start publishing our topic there. So each topic will have to release for us to be alone release. A short one goes in between each release. We've called the university topics. So essentially each topic will have on one country bar

Unknown Speaker  5:55  
and not fully the next is to use cross tabulations for football about more of a tool that we use to do this, but essentially once you get this stage, you can open it up and I want people to keep on census tables to complete general health information and to hear whatever really meets the user needs. And then lastly, we have maybe their origin destination they're a little bit more niche product, still very important, and workplace. So I should mention that alongside this we will be publishing a lot of commentary and analysis and save and develop the website. Make sure it's usable and accessible. And including interactive visualization and hope with maps, I think reception maps. A really good way of getting people to look at data may not have otherwise seen from other census ons recently interactive visualization maps, and yet seems to be working really well for users. So our premium dissemination two for 2022 principal being flexible table builder, and this will allow users to create their own tables. So the reason we're here is an asset based on feedback from users. It's quite elegant census was seen but they did publish wasn't claiming the next republish, and hundreds of open tables but still uses our data. And we offer the commission to get in touch and ask That's correct. Thank you sir in process and people may not be aware of it. So as we publish census data, we will add it to flex with human programming in the users in case you need and subject to is called exposure control that will be applied as developer tables we will know instantly if the data that you want and will also present documentation and treatment which will have you as a team over the table that needs to somehow do that. So one of the things that you just do at the same account, as you mentioned that can speed at no charge is that you can save the game as you go also usually you can save sport grip is a geographies. So if users have penetrated the US Census data to develop a training center it is you won't have to add every single thing you're able to get once you get a name. That means it can be used for any table you build after that. So it was the testing that's we had a better run with users. We received some good feedback. There was a lot of there but we think that the benefits of the major security it was worth it. And we still run off of commission TV service. To make sure that people aren't able to get through to children how to read

Unknown Speaker  8:50  
the geography of the census therefore, lessons are less than sometimes called standard geographies and the only reason we look for standards that pretty much for every census the table builder, so I'm not sure but that's pretty much one thing that we remove some of the geographies LCDC postcode sector, based on user feedback people weren't entirely sure what the wavelengths and using that functionality the device was, even though they're precise, fill in the gaps and forgot digital geographies. I mentioned that every geography on this lesson we will publish the most up to date version at the time when the Census Day is available. So we won't wait for geography. So there we go. So for instance, this is a very popular Geography The user should have made most of the beverages available when census data is ready so we can publish by citizen

Unknown Speaker  9:56  
and then you have some of our non standard geographies. Again, this is because they don't quite fit. So this geographies here and provides a really interesting analysis using them so we have intermediate zones. Which is workplace once you get squares, which is a new geography to compare some more science videos across the UK and internationally. For us, one of the things that we're looking to do is not quite at geography, but we know that a lot of users use lookups to do some analysis when looking at census data. And so rather than making use of them with the census data to look up and do that the sales are looking to produce or make them come to the table quota. Sampling scenario SMD or bureau classification. So, we also have the census geography, so called the census, because the boundaries are redrawn once we have the US Census. So here we have census based segments localities, so segments are a group of high density postcards containing a minimum 500 residents. These are critical targets for schools and settlement of the census. So it is which I mentioned was local geography that republished census therefore, give an idea of the size of these with over 46,020 cases, and they are created by aggregating a small number of postcodes that may be in single postcode, imperiousness, possible designed to meet specials or in our statistical disorder control and the opioid isn't really they kind of building block consensus there so any geography consensus is built using somebody's exact specs for the boundaries much like local authorities and lots of these geographies we have the island groups. So these are used for analysis to look into Scotland's inhabited islands and for the love and the respect these experts have one residence so to make this geography available, and make sure that we're not in some small islands, and islands, potential confidentiality, and what so I chose to do a little research to make not get into other pieces to the size of the census collection. And lastly, this is a geography that Scotland produced and it's actually struggling but one that a lot of census data users use regularly is the dips on boundaries. And we'll work closely with Scottish government making sure they have access to these as quickly as possible in the users. Houses. Key points about this same issue are small enough statistics is gone. And we will use across the public and private sector and the large numbers to be presented accurately. Disclosure are small enough that they can be used to represent committees. Vacation of zones are often used to approximate large area geography. So again, as soon as they're available, publish them and flexible tables. You can publish them so yeah, there's a lot of times for publishing since there and to share with you the feedback we've had so far. You know, the distances there's the basic data sets that we use regularly and research pieces. And since then, it's very valuable to use a lot by researchers. So a quick overview of our slides when we sent outside the lines to the constitutional buyers, they want to get in touch.

Unknown Speaker  14:27  
The end of the month again two questions. Firstly, the flexible table builder. Is that a bespoke piece of technology that you yourselves are relying on some other infrastructure?

Unknown Speaker  14:59  
Yes, it was it was already available and we've used that and added some customization of it so it's going up and struggling senses used it. So I think DWP use it for their budgeting have made some amendments to that so that we can use some of our senses.

Unknown Speaker  15:17  
To divide the geospatial format as an output because I think most of us as GIS analysts get fed up with doing these attribute joins, taking a table joining it to the boundary

Unknown Speaker  15:30  
there's a lot more than once we probably want to make possible arrests and functionalized produce marks within it. So at the moment that is there, and we're just checking that it's in a market functionality we want to use the students to go there and some physical work for the analysis and visualization. So something

Unknown Speaker  15:56  
then one final question if Community Councils are the levers to administration of governance in Scotland, I'm just interested as to why I know it's not as robust as some of the other ones but have you considered publishing data community council level so that we can empower our communities and our citizens to understand what's going on in their local neighborhoods and have a great day and what's happening?

Unknown Speaker  16:24  
I'm not too sure about that one. But I would say that if there is a need there, get in touch and find out isn't the geography team. Essentially, if we can build on the company's nucleus, then as an it's a possibility, it just depends on the museum commander for that. As I said, sort of what we've got is built off user feedback from a few years ago and try to develop it so the consultations on chance to do that. And we're looking at the responses from the consultation. Can off the top of my head remember seen

Unknown Speaker  16:56  
that but I haven't put it in yet.

Unknown Speaker  17:04  
It's more point. Or a plea from one of the non GIS professionals in here although I'm a planner of people don't know they need maps tool they know they need maps, and they don't know that something visualize that they can see that looks like a pretty picture, which is effectively what a map has been for the last six or 700 years is actually the most useful way to display data. So as JRO are working with us on the geolocation, it might be a really big challenge to get as much of this visualized as possible and get away from Excel spreadsheets, Access databases. Because all that does is force people to write war and peace. And we end up with really dry Word documents where a map can tell 1000 things really quickly and tell you something interesting. And it's geospatial data. It's all about a place. It's where people live. And if you can get into a map base, you can then have the people speaking to you with the lived experience and everything else as well. And it will mean that you can swipe that data to where you can't if we have to have somebody who can analyze Excel spreadsheets.

Unknown Speaker  18:15  
And everyone ready for mass your own business, can even API see visualizations, marketing, and we're just trying to get as much as we can take away from the sales that people no okay. Do we have

Unknown Speaker  18:42  
any last questions?

Unknown Speaker  18:57  
Does anyone have any views as to why so many Scots are not actually yeah, there's a lot of people looking at reviews of the claim exercise and I think generally some of these are becoming more difficult to get a good global response for Yeah, I'm not on the cutting side doesn't mean that we cannot have a quick look into the strengths and weaknesses and instead of math, the future census court so there's a lot of work on looking at what we need from any future census is on large data collection. And yeah, I've not seen it myself yet, but I'm sure that will be made available. Yeah, it's a tricky one to try. To get there from everyone and so on.

Unknown Speaker  19:52  
James, thank you so much, and thank you to all of our speakers.

### note

Unknown Speaker  0:01  
I think resilience I'm really pleased to see the theme of today because resilience speaks for so many of the things that matter most today matter most of the things that that we can help with as a profession. For an organization like Ordnance Survey, attention to detail has always been at our core. For centuries, and certainly decades, our attention to detail is driven water wars to build produce great data, but previously known as gray matter, I think it's okay to acknowledge an organization like ourselves we're going through a monumental transformation ourselves to transition from being if you'd like a national Mapping Agency was the application data authority in our own right. And that is both easy words to say that from the way in which we collect data, the way we hold data and manage that asset, and the way we publish it to our users and our customers. That is driven monumentally different considerations in architecture, and collaboration and the way in which we're working. I can promise you a presentation today that has no maps. But I think it is a note that increasingly, you will see yourself as a location data business as a as a technology organization that uses technology to do data. And yes, along the way from that we also produce a few maps that data, absolutely our core today. I think there's, there's a few things which you know, I kind of worry a little bit that we overlook, and like and I'm so pleased to see a number of the presentations going on this morning, because so much of what we do still underpins what I'd almost call this, the fundamentals of organizing. So it's probably there's many reasons why our organization started doing some of the things that we did many, many years ago, but the concept of one registration and this sort of unique and relatively unique process, we have the United Kingdom where you go through both versions of Scotland and HLR. And the same in Northern Ireland, we have a quirky relationship between land registration and national mapping. It's a little bit different from across the rest of the world but the fundamental relationship between the boundaries that we catch, capture our online registration system, the way that has evolved to support planning and planning processes, and indeed right out to the designation of sites and protected areas. And there's other things that today, many of us use many of you curate this room, you know, it's absolutely fundamental and I think we sometimes overlook just the huge amount of effort that still goes in across all of our practicing organizations that support the honoree station, transport planning programs, and support many of the different designations and classifications of land will be ticked around here. From a resilience perspective, we're, we're given a huge wealth of opportunities to go out today. You know, there's so many different aspects of government and national level at an international level at a local level, that speak to the demand for resilience and, you know, it's fine to use the word resilience, but resilience kind of stands for a period of trust, a degree of authority, reassurance, you know, we need to make sure that you know, what we're standing for in this community is a set of trusted, assured, stacked standards, data technologies and services that adequately underpin those various policies that are available to us. I think something else which always stands out to me and you know, at the end, it's like this is just how much as a community we stand for collaboration. seems an odd thing to do. You know, certainly in my career working on Ordnance Survey being involved in communities like KGI you know, that we feel the need to still say that collaboration is important. As collaboration is sort of defined much as how we've worked over the last few decades. But you can see, and I think we're going to hear a number of presentations this afternoon. Talk about the importance of community and collaboration in tackling, resolving applications. I think that's particularly true. And examples of probably that are in the back that that around security, security and resilience go hand in hand. This Morning about resilience in energy. We heard about resilience and community we heard about resilience and understanding our society better. There's certainly some of the applications which probably stand out and malls are those that are securities and the number of different agencies to get involved. I know that one of the presentations following you this afternoon kind of detail. From our own organization, we've done a number of different things looking at security and different applications as to one example where you can start to see the very many different aspects of the geospatial data underpinning the assessment of coastlines in this case, the resilience of coastline in terms of border security and infringement, so taking in aspects of slope in terms of accessibility, visibility and applicability, overall risk of coastline around Great Britain which has huge interest for a variety of different applications. And that's only possible by bringing together trusted, assured data that can be relied upon and conveyed to audiences who need the most. That's they'll always come back to critical infrastructure. And you know, it's interesting that this article today we heard from John and his team talking about what you know, can only be considered as part of critical infrastructure and talking about the importance of geospatial data underpinning that. So I'm registration at the utility infrastructure of Great Britain, UK, they're fundamentally attributed to our data. And I think it's really important that we recognize that but your attention to detail the attention to the continued maintenance of that information, that's kind of what sort of drives much of our work today is fundamentally part of the UK is critical infrastructure. And I think, you know, that's something which Ordnance Survey can credibly say, but I think, you know, we say that standing amongst the community of others in this room that you should be able to say, very similar our work stands at the level of critical infrastructure. I think what we're seeing is a very significant change. And I think this morning's presentation is really brought out for me was that we're no longer looking at maps and that kind of disconnected place or not context, the great data that we produce is not just context against which boundary station boundaries combat utility circuit assets that we can use information we're trying to show that it's not about connecting pieces of information together. Location as a user slide, I'm going to use it as a common denominator at the end, but it's one of the few pieces of data allows us to integrate data to make data interoperable. We've used in this community, whether they happen somewhere for a long time, but I think that's a really important concept to hold on to because I believe those are actually happened more and it's really important that we understand in this room how to use the power of location, how to make location enables that collaboration in data terms. Collaboration, this terms of the next few years will not be the same as us getting around the table and sharing data and think about things you know, if you've not explored the geospatial capabilities of Chachi btw, I'd encourage you to start and have a look at that is really quite incredible to see how data will be used to bring relationships together and do that and we need to show an interest in that development and third data, our technology algorithms or know how those collectively been used to do that. Using this line for a couple of years now and I keep altering the data at the top if you like but 2023 For me, this speaks to a whole new era of opportunity. And yes, a lot of that is technology driven. You're seeing monumentally large amounts of information being available to us. And I think I worry that as a profession, we may be constraining ourselves in terms of the types of information that we think we use data from space data from sensors, data from IoT, data from wearables, data that's being collected in bulk from Transformers or hearing earlier on today. There is a enormous amount of spatial data that's available today. We tend to use in a fairly narrow contacts within projects to work towards

Unknown Speaker  8:47  
is really difficult to put your arms around the wealth of data is available locally, nationally, globally, and use that. And when you start to see some of the technologies that are on that diagram, you start to see the huge wealth of data that will be available to us, and how we should start to make better use of as well as the data being available. We've got phenomenally great technology to make use of that data to ask questions to the right insights, but not the data itself is not actually that useful, but the insights that we can derive from it is very, very powerful indeed. And so far and to communicate that and ways in which we've not been able to communicate that the past I think, is really, really significant. So I think something which is challenging our organization, something which I think to challenge all of us as a community is to think you're really quite radically about the way in which we tend to present ourselves when we're looking at just different projects. I think we really need to lift ourselves into the world, which is inhabiting some of those terms on the screen and see the opportunity to not they're not disruptions that come along and kind of have an impact on our work, but they're opportunities to do our work with ever greater impact and have greater effects. It's just really, really interesting to look at. And for us to remain resilient as a community remains the result of applications that we programmed for us to remain resilient. As a community it is important that we scale ourselves, that we're embracing these opportunities and we're thinking beyond our traditional views of geospatial doesn't already have it. There's a number of things that are on that previous slide that I guess, are driving our kind of thoughts. So the things that feel very relevant to us at the moment is is there a huge amount of data that's coming available to see on a global but on a national basis, some of that we might be directly sponsoring the other datasets that are just available? We should make use of those talking about GNSS and pn T there's a huge amount of interest at the moment around positioning technologies. And the resilience of position itself is something which I think we should all have a just a bearing on. Just because it's come from a GNSS device does not necessarily mean it's as accurate or as or as definitive as you might think it is. And really having a concept as to know where things are. And the accuracy of the resolution of that position is is increasingly important because I haven't talked about that since we were laying a grand triangulation of Great Britain at one point. There's a whole range of different automation levels. AI and machine learning all the things which are certainly helping us automate some of our data collection in ways that we've not been able to pursue before that way beyond that, in terms of their inferring the insight in terms of revealing patterns. In terms of connecting information together. We're seeing a huge amount of opportunity and interest within that. So I think on the bottom there, you know we increasingly see the world as a sustainable place as a healthy place, most fundamentally a connected place. I think something which we're very, very focused on as a woman is thinking not just about the data that we offer, but how our data serves to provide a connection between the multitude of data that's available almost more. Most organizations in this room are using some aspects of our data to drive data have their own pre attribution to enrich that for themselves. And then we recognize that data so to be seen in that context, facilitate that ever more easily. Couple of forecasts later on today, and talk very kindly about the PSG public sector geospatial agreement. Public Sector geospatial agreement started a couple of years ago with three broad aims. One of that was to enrich the data that that we helped to develop a National Geographic database and in line with our users needs, recognizing that they're changing dramatically. It was to ensure that that data could be made evermore accessible, particularly across the physical public's across the public sector. So they establish on the geospatial Commission and the contracting of the national mapping service to ourselves. One of the key objectives of that was to make sure that the data was far more accessible across the public sector. And then finally, to make it easier to use, I just want to kind of talk a little bit in a couple of slides about how we're setting out to do that. The National Geographic database in some respects is all was left at the heart of Ordnance Survey was the core data asset. The you forget us first. For many years that asset was created in order to produce maps that are detailed maps, maps, you'll notice things like I said, the OS MasterMap topography layers, the rich data sets behind that, but that in itself was quite limiting. So if you want a large scale definitive topographic map that allows you to map your assets against even pro democracy, you will find it hard to find a better one in the world. On saying that, if you then want to use that same map base as the basis for interoperability and to connect datasets together and to drill in and add your attribution to share it and use it and data science and machine learning, why is most new technologies much much more difficult? And so to really try and unpack that the National National Geographic database has really been unleashed to allow much greater granularity and access and easier access to those core data things. We've restructured ngd around nine key themes of information, organize that array of feature types worked really hard to publish that at the level of different standards and so give access to the granular notion of their 600 million or half a billion individual features of information within that to which you can start to attribute your information to start to to underpin this other data infrastructures of tomorrow, as well as the underpinning that basis model has also started to release that in different ways. The ng D in terms of API is making that more available. We're really committed to looking for geospatial consortiums, we've helped develop their API standards for sharing map bases and features based on particular and we've started to release those as a range of different data services and feature types, but also for those of you who just want to go into the database, select the features that you want, build your own packet information and download that or select and build allows you to do that. Exactly. They're gonna skip over that. I think one of the for me just two things to finish on really looking at a few couple minutes left. If there was one application which I feel increasingly passionate about their collection of a community and do something positive in response to sustainability, it's taking climate action. As an organization, we've looked at ourselves and defined our own organizational principles about how we will address sustainability within our organization, we realize we've got an increasingly large footprint with an influence. We can set the example to others as to how to approach of sustainability as an organization that particularly in the right hand side of the slide, we can use our influence as a national mapping service to lead and inspire bold actions and how we approach sustainability, how we power data collected and how our data is used to deliver against sustainable outcomes. We developed a program of work around 12 months ago where we identified key specific areas that we were interested more in addressing climate action. We brought together last year, around 100 leaders from national mapping agencies from around the world conference organiser has been hosting since 1928. I think every four years interest conference to bring leaders together and rather than just talking about how challenging national mapping activities were, we talked about what we could do together to inspire taking action against climate change and to rise the climate challenge that documents are being published by the United Nations which we're really proud about the other initiatives that we've kicked off with a few stakeholders in this room and others is something called the supply chain Data Partnership, where we recognize that one thing we can do as an organization is to convene organizations together. We recognize hope. However, there is information about supply chains commercial supply chains is that where goods are moved from source and transit. And these are increasingly subject to huge amounts of finance and financial investment with financial investments, which are kind of relying on the fact that things are where they say they were, and things are what they say they were and so we're trying to bring a number of different groups together to to give assurance and get the trust that supply chains that exist globally around the world. And that's something we're working on at a global level with a number of different partners.

Unknown Speaker  17:56  
I guess it just really wanted to finish off on one slide with a which was just the kind of question a few things and maybe wasn't sure where the agenda was gonna speed. So I was going to be holding off just the levers, a few challenges, and I think the first one is the gas, you know, location and resilience work hand in hand. So what are we doing to be resilient amongst ourselves? I think there is a need for us to think really hard about data and technology and how that impacts on our work. Are we resilient in our knowledge, and our skills? I think it's a great way to finish the face and conference. I'm really looking forward to that the last session this afternoon, so I think it's possibly the most important theme of being a resilient community. I think the partnership model it's been demonstrated so many times today is really important. resilience comes through working with others learning from others collaborating together. I think the final one for me is being resilient in our value proposition, our stories and delivering impact. And I think it's increasingly really important that the stories we tell are really focused on the impact that we're having. And it was great this morning to see so many people think it's really important, but beyond everything happened somewhere in demonstrating on a map, World of data science and increasing levels of information. It's increasingly important that we're able to demonstrate our value proposition in the work we do. I'm going to finish it there. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to offer a few thoughts after one.

Unknown Speaker  19:28  
Thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  19:39  
Love the last slide. Any any questions?

Unknown Speaker  20:01  
Decision Yeah, I think so. I mean, so for me, I think perhaps we take it to for granted of us to implicit in revealing patterns in making sure that the value that we present through our data through our knowledge or our know how, as well appreciated, well understood, I guess, maybe, maybe these bubbles are presenting my anxiety for us as a profession that over the next few years as skilled people dramatically we're able to continue to demonstrate the importance and advantage

Unknown Speaker  20:45  
I think we need to be working backwards from that every single time but not always starting with Yeah, this is the tank we've got this is the data we've got the problem, you know, focusing on problems and working backwards, but I don't think we've got the right data. I don't think we've always got the right path. I don't think those are the right skills to be able to transpose and I think you're seeing it hugely with climate action. You know, fantastic opportunities to solve problems at global level, but it still remains quite difficult to take action at a local level and connect the two together. I think the solution to those kind of problems sits in rooms like this. I think we can do more to do

Unknown Speaker  21:28  
that so maybe some of your thoughts, David from irises perspective on the end of this kind of expanding evolution

Unknown Speaker  21:45  
I think the blue economy is a huge opportunity. We spend a lot of time talking to our colleagues educational and I think it's a showing some of the current gear today. I think we're probably over the last two to three years, we've just realized how much we have in common. And I think that's a reflection of the fact that how much our worlds have come together. There isn't an artificial boundary at the coastline anymore. So quite aside from the fact that the coastal zone itself is something that you've got many organizations focused on together. Many of the principles we're working on on land just transcend the bigger the offshore and back again, I think you should agree example it's more but you know, we've been talking quite a bit with you you guys show a good example of just even the movement of goods, the transportation of goods and education we're here to be talking about bunkers that is that you know once we can get our aircraft constantly world landing when they're supposed to one being sort of shedule if you bring a big container boat, it's still sat offshore waiting for someone to adult and unload on just changing some of that so that we can manage those things better, let alone the fact that when the goods and don't say the bangle to be moved off and go somewhere else, so they can have joining again. So are these artificial barriers or barriers but not an artificial similar to something that your rates and we're working really closely with UK and others. Thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  23:24  
Our next presenter this afternoon, we are huge thanks to for standing in with the last change to the program. So great pleasure to introduce IDPH head of geospatial marketing at the geospatial commission. And I'll be presenting today on stressing foundations for driving innovation.

Unknown Speaker  23:50  
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. It's great to be a hero for turning up and filling us but it's really a privilege. Here we need to come together and talk about all the amazing uses of being excited about what we're doing at the visual commission. Really great conference

## Technology Enhanced Collaboration in Disaster Risk Reduction: UK and International Experience

Unknown Speaker  0:02  
As Catholics for innovation, reasons to address challenges faced by government, industrial communities and so on, as you can see, we have been developing in the past 15 years. collaborative platforms for space explorations of design, also getting conception and also for local governments as well. So in competency is about getting data, visualizing situation making taking things in perspective. So as you can see the last plus, that's like I'm so on especially companies that don't have these. See. So, the point is the sub sectors to contribute to things like in that framework, priority one is looking at understanding local. I'll be facing bringing all the local partners together to govern that risk. as well. At the central bank, defeating UN Sustainable goals from building sustainable cities, reducing inequalities and bringing innovation to the industrial at the same time, we have to consider possible climate futures depending on the situation and what does that mean in terms of use that knowledge is driving our economy efforts in different countries. So being academic our to define poverty means something to us beside resilience to our proceedings. In my case, I'm going to look at resilience against climate change for disasters and so there are so many definitions, but use the definition which is the average of a system, community or society exposed that side resist, absorb, accommodate, recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely manner. So from the engineering point of view, we can define the performance of a resiliency document code here, you can see that the system performance is at a high level 100% Depending on how resilient you are, they roll into the black girl losing that performance, it will take a long time to recover. So they desperately push that code to make sure that performance declination is low and you become a fast aspects. Listener says different dimensions if you look at different types of dimension, you can see the freebooks that you can measure it gives you indicators dimension obviously, you can imagine this college of five human health dimensions, then an independent dimension so one dimensions could have impact on other, we're seeing that employees that come across the governance aspect and so on. So think about that system thinking there How is each part of segments could impact on the dimension as well. So when a decision point that we can control that term in terms of filling, anticipated capacity, absorbed your capacity to push them so anticipated capacities, whatever your system is, so the disaster concept is what that means is looking at the replication adaptation of balanced preparedness system. Capacity means understanding what you want to do with these, reducing them. Response distance, these sorts of structures historically capacities, but making sure you have mechanisms and funding to do the damage assessment that you have business continuity plans in place. So if you take that into consideration, one of the fundamental thing is to understand the local so the local risk risk is a functional Mozart's this was a wonderful thing. At the same time is kind of your system citizens are connected to each other and at the same time, this is quite important as well to bring different partners together and then build this kind of capacity that resonance is not static. It will change I will change over time with an interchange obviously this will change as well. So this needs to change, understand what is the local urban projects will bring more results, more vulnerabilities you also need to understand how this will change. So that really requires a multi agency collaboration working together so we had the privilege to have funding from the global challenges research wants to go to consultancy London for this to strengthen their digital infrastructure by bringing the local data this data and visualizing and allowing them to plan different scenarios and realize that predicts technology is not the solution. So we have the second most collaborative governance that we put in place which are that they work together judges. How do you think this is an important design of engaged, how you can see climate change for future investment? Potential and then we add on the projects so we are funded by World Bank, the UK Government to apply this cultural district in Sri Lanka, Manchester and also in southern province of Sri Lanka, and also set up in Malaysia for sharding. So this helps us to work with partners are going from the ministers to the industry them together to build that communication to really take into this. So when you try to bring this geospatial domain, to build resiliency for complex challenges, that means that you have to face this inside of this approach. People are no challenges and have their own systems. And also there's no mandate to cooperate to address this kind of community in a collective manner. Don't just listen, governance are some of the dysfunctions we see no policies to operate, and same time shopping and so on. So those are things to consider others talk about as always another challenge. So if I take these two aspects, so England and Scotland we have global resilience. So since forums as a good level of collaboration, partners coming together to understand the local residents and so on, but mainly focusing on adaptation and so Chilean backbone is now Disaster Management Center. Collaboration is much hierarchical, silent in this approach, with again, focusing on what is best when it comes to data sharing silica, Pakistan, they have a very everybody collect their own data, Database, Data collected through projects like 6% of time, at the end of the project, that data is gone. There's no continuous improvement and changes mended as well. So there's big data sharing content and so on. So we want to bring this current climate resilience and aspects of challenge. What do you have to say? So there's a little bit of structured data quality data and from all the survey that has made a big difference in the pilot implementation help us build on what how data could be used to push the President's agenda importers and interventional practice that we'd like to bring into the countries like Sri Lanka. In UK we as Assad simulations, and so on for the sharing of the data, meaningful management disaster but in practicing with basic ideas that matter metal the center, primate days into the Technology Agency that they should do from simulation that should produce systems to understand what sort of impacts you're talking about. And then looking at impact based reporting and so on. So that streamline is so so in the in the project budget, we'll be looking at how to pick this kind of geospatial environment for the disaster site adaptation. So we created a platform for mobilize to understand that vulnerability by this local data so you can understand community at risk, infrastructure business, looking at risk return to the land use management and how that is mobilized platform. And then that that information could be fed into a growing impact environment. We talking about this platform, again, when you go to create this risk information space, it also has information behind each one of their stories. I can take them for example, enough time to go shopping centers change during the daytime, which sample is more more higher than nighttime pets and the critical infrastructure in

Unknown Speaker  9:52  
the past isn't go down that production kitchen, that means, you know, in some houses and hospitals and so on, then how the impact that ripple effect in terms of the scope of the region and so, so the idea of the mobilize platform has been totally dependent the council's environment, real time data, bring community data, simulation data, so you can create a visual space to understand what your colleagues are particularly. So in this case. So that means it's all about really bringing them to a human centric, Team centric format. So they're going away from Excel sheets and so on to really understand local warming. So this architecture took a while then. So yeah, I'm just going to show a video of some homework so this concept was then applied Manchester. So we do have three demonstrators one will decide trying to demonstrate how partisan the second one is about community engagement. How can people tell them stories about their environment? So this story is not from the agencies can tell their stories to show what sort of defenses we have made to reduce the risk. You can tell the stories from the committee's third one focus on pilot focus on how this one could be useful. scenario planning that you're gaining insight into be doing.

Unknown Speaker  11:34  
The demonstrate how a different platform that can simulate can be used for multi agency training. Exercise, due to heavy rains have been made aware of the possible impact of the reservoir for residential and commercial properties critical infrastructure as identify the initial concerns of the funding agencies within the first three hours of the breach. This scenario will signify extending the mobilized generated developed world the information provided by the owners and the inundation maps of the reservoir breach provided value was fed into the scenario generator to identify the impact of the reservoir on top of

Unknown Speaker  12:42  
all the exposure data into account. The scenario generator produces a dashboard that illustrates the impact of reservoir on the scenario now allows the trainees to explore the impact of LRS boundary level, council level board level and to conduct the investigation in behind it I think the impact of events Chinese companies on the impact on critical infrastructures such as educational and medical by activating various poverty classification information provided by the generator. trainees are able to switch between the accent visualize the losses and the magnitude of compute by observing the policy by picking on various trainees to gain a better understanding of the potential hybrid carrier. Generate that also allows the trainees to simulate and discuss what actions may need to take before the arrival of a given location and critical infrastructure. The real time simulation allows the trainees to be immersed in potentially communistic scenario as many times as necessary to establish a deeper understanding of the potential and the role of each entity during a disaster.

Unknown Speaker  14:41  
So this is my last one. So that's one example. The second one is what is good Sri Lanka but you can see by taking the last word understanding the Japanese side and also identifying clusters of yours Okay. At the same time interface also give you a live demonstration of platform

### note

Unknown Speaker  0:02  
In some Nazism, we're doing so Civil Contingencies Act is the legislative

Unknown Speaker  0:13  
legislation, for nuclear science for chemical science for flooding, for all manner of things reservoirs is where the CCA is the one that underpins it all.

Unknown Speaker  0:25  
A few things that it does for us the emergency is which sounds like a relatively straightforward thing to do. Multiple emergency and one could say that but an emergency for the emergency services for example, it's very, very different to emergency as a local authority, or a member of the public. So an emergency under the CTA and eventual situation affecting serious questions to human welfare, security or environment. And then importantly, in place of the UK so what that means in reality is yes, it could be a flood that happens in Scotland, but equally it could be Ebola in Africa. That is impacting on the UK. That's still technically a an emergency into the CCN.

Unknown Speaker  1:11  
What it also does establishes what are called category one and category two responders. So category one responders are generally local authorities, emergency services, health colleagues, and tattoos are transport companies, utility colleagues as well. And cat ones and cat twos have statutory duties. On the CCA which I'll come on to.

Unknown Speaker  1:33  
And then finally what it does is it forms are called Local resilience partnerships and local resilience forums in England, emergency response groups in Northern Ireland, they're basically the same thing. They're not statutory organisations, but they are a group that brings those those individual organizations together as a as a club in order to fulfill their statutory duties. And an important caveat, I think you've probably heard a lot through COVID about local resilience partnerships are at what they do. They don't do anything they don't exist. As statutory bodies, the organization with it, do all the work.

Unknown Speaker  2:11  
So duties for cat ones either as it goes through this just start thinking about geospatial because it falls into pretty much every single one. assess the risk of emergencies occurring. So on David's presentation earlier, there was the National Risk Register and Scottish documents for preparing for emergencies. You look at what could possibly harm and hurt over the coming years, and then you assess it within your own locality. So if you're a landlocked area, you're not going to start planning for coastal flooding. It's pointless, because if one crucial don't do planning for tsunamis, for example, emergency funds to mitigate the effects of those that's put in place business continuity arrangements or something happens again reducing the impact of those you want to make sure that you could continue your your critical function. So that's what you'll see is looking at warning and informing the public now you could use media, radio, but again a map producer, cooperate with local responders. So that multi agency coordination and share information with them which is an important one, because the data protection can be somewhat trumped by the CCA. So if you're dealing with a major incident, you're doing the response and you're looking to share information on vulnerable people. Don't quote I'm not sharing that because the data protection is nonsense if you need to share it because its response and you're looking at preserving live, share it, you share what you have to share.

Unknown Speaker  3:41  
And then finally providing advice and assistance for businesses and voluntary bit of a weird one. This is only on local authorities. I think probably because, you know coming up with this didn't know how to give it season they just don't download for authorities. Really it's just wherever we want to do that we're giving business and giving voluntary agencies that advice.

Unknown Speaker  4:03  
That to us if I just

Unknown Speaker  4:08  
focus on those two, they only have two of those two of those duties are very, very important ones which is cooperating and sharing information as we're going to be thinking about utility companies. We had a water outage in luxr area just before Christmas seeking 1000 properties off. We're looking at sharing information about who those people are going to do that on the Civil Contingencies. That's in a response. They also want to be doing it when you're planning for it as well.

Unknown Speaker  4:40  
So what do most nations should do?

Unknown Speaker  4:45  
You have national risk for venue as I said, locally. So these are ours. You see pandemic's at the top, we've actually been on them for the software ages. It was there well before COVID For a long time afterwards, is still one of the top risks in respect of the impact of it and the likelihood of it occurring which I'm sure everyone will be pleased to know. Flooding, terrorist attack, industrial accident, loss of water, loss of power, severe weather, heatwaves storms, so those are all of our risks. And you see on the right hand side, you rank them along the lines of likelihood.

Unknown Speaker  5:25  
And the hierarchies of the Reds to go that's what we're doing sighs planning around the yellow, we're going to be getting more generic planning, and then you accept the rest of that.

Unknown Speaker  5:38  
So moving on to the geospatial elements of it. What I've tried to do is split these things up three things up to just show you where you've got resilience, planning specific data that falls into normal data like that. So if you're looking at doing a specific plan, I've got a case study on it on a nuclear side. You're looking at doing a specific point, you're going to create data that is unique to that, but you don't really need to use it for anything else. So some of the examples there that site location and the boundary of the site. Generally what happens if it's, if it's a site from the regulation, then you will have what's known as a competent authority that will tell you the risk area around there. So if you live in that area, you want to know the potential risks. We do what's called the geographic risk area, which basically makes a bit more common sense of that.

Unknown Speaker  6:33  
So when you get a cordon of risk, which we'll show you in a second, it generally is just a circle. Now that cuts through Chris's house, which doesn't really make much sense when you say to her that if you go into your into your bathroom, you're perfectly fine, but if you if you stay in the front, you're likely to die. So what we do is we extend it out to about three and that's what we use the geographic area for access egress routes or control points or rendezvous points or control points, marshaling points, evacuation points, traffic control flows, all manner of different points that we use during the emergency response. And then we might use emergency sentences as well. So that horrible term of the call rest centers when you don't go to rest of them that you've got nowhere to go. You need to evacuate. The generally leisure centers with plastic chairs, you know, I'm gonna be resting but if we've identified those that go in so Terrence is presentation showing the reservoir inundation that will be receptors evacuation points, identify all the way down.

Unknown Speaker  7:41  
When you move into the risk and the hazard aspects there are datasets that are national datasets and regional datasets that you pull in and utilize on this. So flood warning areas. We don't tend to bother with the flood alert areas from colleagues and bring an Environment Agency that too broad an area of flood warning areas of specific risk. We've talked about reservoir for the extents, como controller Matrox and hazard regulations. Basically, it's just it's a site that has some nasty chemicals that if there's an incident at the site, you don't want to be near it. So that's what COVID site is and erect this site Radiation Emergency Preparedness as a nuclear site for nuclear power station.

Unknown Speaker  8:25  
major accident hasn't pipelines you don't see these both north or south across the UK are these big pipelines that carry ethylene and other substances. So those are under the ground but if they go you don't want to be near them. They have a thing called a thermal hazard range. Which have a guess at what happens within.

Unknown Speaker  8:47  
And then finally, sort of normal data from an organizational level. So you'll have your own premises, your blue lines will have their premises you might have schools, children's centers, you might have where your staff live. And so you might not necessarily want to map their exact property, but maybe that postcode area, you might have to so that means different things for different organizations. From a local authority perspective, we might have vulnerable adults who are receiving care. So theoretically a customer will refer to it as just a broad brush.

Unknown Speaker  9:21  
And then vulnerable, vulnerable users as well, which, again, depending on the incident, depending on the time of year depending on the location, it could be vulnerable for all manner of things.

Unknown Speaker  9:33  
So what I'll do is I'll take you through a few slides. Just building a bit of a case study of ation of the planning data that goes in that then can be used in response and then we'll move forward a little bit. So the you've got the site boundary there, which is the dashed area and there's two points that station one information to the two power stations that are there. Those two circles are the risk areas that have been defined about 1.45 kilometers from the location. So we have to as a local authority do in depth planning for anyone who's within that area. And war that inform them and put in place an off site plan in the event that someone else about the future, but is a bit rubbish on Tuesday. So that's why we do the geographic. So that's the blue line so we just can't go with it. What would go go around the outside the reason that extends so far to the right is as luck would have it, we also have a chemical side execution as well. So take into account that what we can do is then split those up into more natural them too. If you ever want to go out for it and go for a day out of Asia and you've got you can arrive from the Isle of Man into the docks. You've got a nature reserve and a golf course. You can stay over at the caravan park itself. There is a nuclear power station. But what we see is quite warm around the outside.

Unknown Speaker  11:01  
So what we're doing is we split those zones up it makes a bit more sense when you're saying to police officers evacuate the residential zone rather than evacuate this courtroom, which which makes no sense for anyone. So that's why we split that one off.

Unknown Speaker  11:15  
You then got apologies with symbology on this but you wouldn't normally display these two things together. So the red route and the Blue Route that's just coming from the bottom there were fraud and survey animals that symbology doesn't really matter.

Unknown Speaker  11:30  
The red roots and the blue group are two different ways into the site depending on where the winds and normally the wind will be blowing. From the from the southwest. So you've got to have different different access routes.

Unknown Speaker  11:46  
Otherwise, if you've only got one and the wind's blowing that way, you're a little bit sculpted.

Unknown Speaker  11:51  
And then you start to build on your traffic control points which you build as you go out and then sequenced colors it gets quite big depending on how bad the day was occasion. So you can see just on the on the right hand side that you're going right down the unsettled towards Carlisle as well potentially shutting the entire sector. That very, very low likelihood, by the way, with that happening.

Unknown Speaker  12:20  
And then just put the white slide on so that when they do the PDFs that they have no one gets all those marks on the internet.

Unknown Speaker  12:27  
So those are the maps of what we've done to actually define and tell the story when we do the planning. But we then need to do the do the in depth assessment.

Unknown Speaker  12:37  
And I got away from lunch for a few years and when I came back the some poor soul have been trying to do this assessment by clicking on individual datasets and then googling the address and then getting the details often which was taking them weeks and weeks. I'm late. So we managed to put that right and go don't go back to GIC. What we were looking to do is coming up with a consistent method of which we could assess what's going on within an area that doesn't continue and clearly you will then have that assessment of the time of the responsible eligibility. But it gives it more baseline that we can use to look at three o'clock in the morning things like this, this and this. So what we did is we worked with on survey to develop some post just code and then wretchedly into SQL as well so it links up with those hazards, hazards shapefiles. You can get off the internet with the classification codes from address space and means that we can just quickly feed in a polygon and press a button and get those get that data out.

Unknown Speaker  13:46  
Looking at that into a bit of a wider extendibility. What we also then do is use the OS national grid, we have to think about going out to 30 kilometers is really really bad. There's no point doing that because they're doing that impact assessment after 30 kilometers from that country. And so we thought rather the easiest way to do it is use LS GB split into the 5k sectors and then we can run it that way. That's how we built last couple of slides, vulnerable premises or vulnerable people is one thing that we need to really start looking at as best as we do is a list of people who've got a list of vulnerable people it's not it's not perfect.

Unknown Speaker  14:26  
So we need to start utilizing unique property reference number and just put a quote we don't need to know the detail. We don't need to know why someone's vulnerable. We just need to know that building have got some people in which organization is interested in it. So that's 2023 piece of work.

Unknown Speaker  14:44  
On a response side, we need to look at multi agency information sales. There's a thing called the Jessup job doctrine. Google it, I won't go into detail now cuz I'm running out of time. But that's where we should be putting geospatial and GIS games during a response. So we need to make sure people are in there sort of taking the data and then telling the story to the decision makers, because if we don't put it in, they'll make it all the time potentially not have all of the information.

Unknown Speaker  15:11  
And that's why you might consider you utilizing Ordnance Survey for emergencies. Last two slides and just as a bit of a case study this was before my time at work before and you suffer use of GIS during a cholera outbreak in London. So Jon Snow was looking at some outbreaks of disease and he met a load of the the psychological analysis and he was able to pinpoint the location of the Broad Street pump in summary, where all the dots and crosses are the locations of the pump.

Unknown Speaker  15:44  
So just to summarize that, what that might look in 2023 for a map you get the same kind of effect. So just the importance.

Unknown Speaker  15:53  
And then finally to summarize, GIS in resilience, efficient. That's a decision making improved communications but most importantly, GIS is.

Unknown Speaker  16:19  
one one question.

Unknown Speaker  16:24  
Silence We could just get done to remind everyone about the 23rd of March of dynamic details on our website.

### note
Unknown Speaker  0:02  
We are cloud technologies that we do anything that's not just ourselves. All that stack is basically the advantage of being able to deploy stuff really quickly. And that's where we have all the reference books. So we are going through the motions of doing that organisation that is working for us to do because we're kind of Christmas or somewhere because it's kind of based we can do weekly updates, we can dictate updates, continuously updates as we go. So it's no version history to the whole thing, which is great things. But it seems that things keep going. And we have set it as an organisation from using open source. Our entire technology stack is based on open source software and systems. So we've got questions, we've got all sorts of open projects. And we've just put them together into a package. So we've dealt with because we've done that need to make sure that software has easy flow of data in and out of it. So it was a software you can take based

Unknown Speaker  1:07  
organisation to something big and scary, again, quite a bit using our software, but it's great to work with these guys. I was gonna listen to on our phones and parish council of Lagos. So on to what I'm talking about today. So we started an initiative project. And what this is is a one year free access to mapping software to try and kickstart the use of mapping in new councils. That means Cass has been mentioned a few times over the course of the day from the census data and different levels of how can you see the resulting variance and we have a lot of experience in that way of doing this and how we're going about it

Unknown Speaker  1:49  
project is ourselves just improving service training organisation based on mobile devices. So what we are doing is we are doing some freebies but basically don't get me cancelled.

Unknown Speaker  2:08  
Why are we doing that? Well, we think that castles and mapping software there are some really good things to do with it. So the Keystone project that we're going to be using this for is a place once again, there's an active team that's planning so they also like to make the plans they ratified. What can you cancel workers council wants to do in their local area in terms of planning development spaces into the policy at the highest priority level and makes a difference. So it's about communities actually having their say in planning policy readings right. There are other areas in macroeconomics and uses of mapping projects and you could tie into this as well as we apply the plan is actually kind of quite popular thing. wide reaching areas and ideas on using Community Councils and occasionally can use counsel for whatever you're interested in. Okay, so why are we doing it? Well, back in 2008 slash line started on a project to get parish councils in England or Wales or parishes, towns and communities to get access to the USGA data because they didn't have access to anything it already is either GIS partner partners and the authorities. And they had all the knowledge that the parish councils didn't. So that was a contraction that spilled something but basically, they can see it got out of hand and they started to do things with it. And they asked us questions and they asked us if we can improve things. So Patreon is a piece of software has evolved over the last 14 years into fully plant based applications on daily basis, and they're using it to help that continuity within their organisation and their day to day tasks like this hedges have escalated. Let's go have a look on three it's actually probably my parish councils in Wales, I have a client who's such as and then our counsellors around and they will come and go the demographic is quite great. It's retired people who are doing this nominee and fascinating to work with. But the problem is they have a high brain drain in parish councils and that's a real problem because our forecast gets their head into the local area. When problems are over paper will be imported into assets have been spotted onto a map that stays in their account. Such organisation wide account carries routines and continuity as a resilience is really key. Also, we've got harvesting global knowledge is really important. So whether the highest authorities like it or not be communities know better than that. They are the ones that know websites. They know where the bones buried, they know where they have all of this information, they know what's going on. But it's not being honest about most. It must be informal, public bodies about this most number of them, but this information isn't being used. It's not being honest. So we started doing that thing that way when we started building together practice projects. So this experiment is to do this with me to castles in Scotland. Well nothing is that real change actually happens locally. So we've seen this really starkly in with parishes is that when device crisis kicked in, they were the ones within days to have that at country setup. They knew because it's farther down the road and really quick at responding to emergencies, whereas the higher tier authorities will have more planning perhaps they'll have better structure to it. But it's it's not on the ground. So we build that knowledge and their ability to be dynamic is risky. That is something that's as a conflict should be fostered. So that's that's the real reason why we're doing this. how we're going to do it, I was advised by my colleagues

Unknown Speaker  6:14  
Anyway, so we we've been doing this for a long time. so why not just rework it tested. Apply it to Scotland. So, we've done that. And so last year to everyone is contributing this software into communities in Scotland, see what happens. We're not going to hurt us where we're not going to charge for it. As an aside, branches.

Unknown Speaker  0:01  
So we're not trying to rent these houses, anything they've got, we're just trying to give them some software, give them that. So that's what we take them off.

Unknown Speaker  0:10  
We have roped in signing the game from the special recruitment service. And they said, We want this data.

Unknown Speaker  0:18  
And so we are putting in all the provinces states. So anything is that we've talked about earlier like that you

Unknown Speaker  0:24  
think it's gonna go in front of the

Unknown Speaker  0:27  
whole team.

Unknown Speaker  0:31  
Everyone that expects it, that's great to have you has real authentic

Unknown Speaker  0:37  
bringing in pest planning Scotland, so they as an organisation and help residents to

Unknown Speaker  0:44  
understand planning process and get assistance from it. So they're funded by government, but they also have to try

Unknown Speaker  0:51  
to provide this training. So we have to let you guys know communities already, you're given training, you guys help them with

Unknown Speaker  0:59  
helping them

Unknown Speaker  1:00  
this week, with the past guys, we're

Unknown Speaker  1:03  
doing that kind of training, training training. And that's been pretty good. They are great.

Unknown Speaker  1:09  
Training agents.

Unknown Speaker  1:14  
So what are we actually doing? So here's a

Unknown Speaker  1:18  
sport not seen mind blank, this is boring stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:23  
Is it mind blowing for some people. So this is just going, let's take some drawing tools make it nice, pretty easy to use, and they don't realise it, but they aren't creating special data, what they're doing,

Unknown Speaker  1:36  
or whatever the project is they're doing. So it's not here exploring areas or areas they want to protect in terms of recreational things, or whether it's where they want to cycle Mexico

Unknown Speaker  1:48  
exists, or somebody wants something, somebody should be sensible. And making it easy for them to draw it

Unknown Speaker  1:57  
can also make good data. So see, on the left hand side, you know, we pre presented all of the attribution.

Unknown Speaker  2:06  
Data

Unknown Speaker  0:01  
So we're not trying to print these horses, anything they've got, we're just trying to give them some software, give them that. So that's what we take them off. We wrote in the game from the special recruitment service, and they said, We want this data. And so we are putting in all the princess things. So everything is that we've talked about earlier like that you think it's gonna go in front of the whole team. Everyone that expects it. That's great. To have real authentic bringing in Parsippany, Scotland, so they as an organisation and help residents to understand planning process and get assistance from it. So they're funded by government, but they also have to find the right time to provide this training. So we have to let you guys know communities already, you will get the training you guys help them with helping this week with the past guys, we'll be doing that kind of training, training. And that's been pretty good. They are great. So really popular with that site, training and bye, right. So what are we doing so here's a sport not seen. mind blank. This is boring stuff. Is it mind blowing for some people? So this is just going let's take some drawing tools. Make it nice, pretty easy to use, and they don't realise it, but they aren't creating special data, what they're doing, or whatever the project is doing. So it's not here. It's drawing play areas or areas they want to protect recreational things more whether it's where they want to cycle Mexico exists once somebody thinks should be sensible and make it easy for them to draw it can also make good data. So see on the left hand side, you know we pre presented all of the attribution but I'm going to drop in several ways

Unknown Speaker  2:08  
to draw in central data,

Unknown Speaker  2:11  
never mentioned

Unknown Speaker  2:14  
that we can use them yesterday. So we can set them so that they can do that. And that's where it's at high quality.

Unknown Speaker  2:16  
that we can start to mask that they can do that and that's where it's at high quality and they don't worry about that computer blowing up which

Unknown Speaker  2:20  
And they don't worry about that computer blowing up switch.

Unknown Speaker  2:25  
died for a passion. But as soon as they say something on on software, it's immediately say, that database database is that to have any credit for that. And

Unknown Speaker  2:38  
that's like something like this, by doing everything cloud based is we can do some really collaborative mapping. So what we've done is we've pre built loads of special export. So loads of posters tables are in our database that presented to the parachutes answer the template, and what's going on behind the scenes is they see their, their own map, you know, plotting out where to plan out where people should go. And the non contentious things like that. So not things we've got to keep secret we can turn into so all of the things councils can work on the same basis, same GIS table and drawing their information. And you've got consistency built in from the beginning.

Unknown Speaker  3:14  
Very happy for when they start working on

Unknown Speaker  3:19  
that screenshot, defibrillator in on three shots, if nothing else, they're

Unknown Speaker  2:25  
they thought started for a passion. But as soon as I say something on on software, it's usually say about database database. Is that to have any credit for that. And that's like something like this by doing everything cloud based is we can do some really collaborative mapping. So what we've done is we've pre built loads of spatial layers. So loads of posters tables are in our database that presented to the parachutes onto the tablet. And what's going on behind the scenes is they see their, their own map, you know, plotting out where to plan out where people should go, and the non contentious things like that. So not things we've got to keep secrets we can turn into. So all of the things councils can work on the same basis, same GIS table and drawing their information and you've got consistency built in from the beginning. It makes it very happy for when they start working on this later. screenshot of a defibrillator and obviously shopsing does nothing else until we get down to

Unknown Speaker  3:30  
not, it's not just about JSA creation, it's also about its analysis as well. So they find it mind blowing experience from the login. Just seeing that they didn't realise we had we had that as well is that that level, but then loading all the other datasets in well, Bloodstones age, but also putting some stuff that we don't have to use, but they would really like to do quite complex. So we just created tools like this, like my supposed to be on springboard.

Unknown Speaker  3:30  
nothing it's not just about JSA creation, it's also about analysis as well. So they find it mind blowing, experience the power of just seeing that person realise well, is that that level, but then loading all the other sets in well, age, but also putting some stuff that we don't have to use, but they would really like to do. So it'd be just right it feels like this like massive capital to springboard. Hopefully, that gets the juices flowing for that area of

Unknown Speaker  4:00  
Hopefully, that gets the juices flowing for that area of

Unknown Speaker  4:10  
special tools that they wouldn't normally

Unknown Speaker  4:13  
has.

Unknown Speaker  4:15  
Also, what's the catalyst is this paper

Unknown Speaker  4:20  
and pencil publishing side of it. So

Unknown Speaker  4:23  
we're not selling. It's based on the present as much as they like. So we've got simple things there by static maps that can print off

Unknown Speaker  4:32  
and more modern methods of possessing the data. So we create shareable links and web maps into their websites to share with show.

Unknown Speaker  4:40  
So

Unknown Speaker  4:42  
bringing in all the kind of common GIS tasks into a nice interface, it's lovely to start doing that

Unknown Speaker  4:50  
initial but they can pick up on it and the initial meeting

Unknown Speaker  4:57  
Okay, so, so far we've run

Unknown Speaker  4:10  
special tools that they wouldn't normally has. My guess is it's by far the publishing side of it, so we're not selling its face on at present as much as they like. So we've got simple things by static map so they can print off and under also more modern methods of processing the data. So we create shareable links and internet websites to share with show. So bringing in all the kind of common GIS tasks into a nice interface, it's lovely to start doing that initial but they can pick up on the initial meeting. Okay, so, so far, we've run a few team sessions on this, we've invited all of these councils to join

Unknown Speaker  5:00  
Have you seen sessions on this, we've invited all these councils to join.

Unknown Speaker  5:05  
We have more than that.

Unknown Speaker  5:11  
But it was great enthusiasm, that people can finally you know, something we can do. That's great. Let's go on to it. And I got a special invite whenever anyone signs up to it, it's going everyday. So we're up to I think, 78. Over the last few weeks, we've been doing this

Unknown Speaker  5:26  
on the SGA side, and that's gonna be fun for those guys coming in.

Unknown Speaker  5:31  
We have really good support from the past as well, to me nice organisations to work with. And so I'd recommend that.

Unknown Speaker  5:37  
And it's a nice old trio where we've got the technology side of the data and the training, education.

Unknown Speaker  5:43  
And

Unknown Speaker  5:45  
also some colour randoms work. So other organisations that feel that they could help with their communities involved.

Unknown Speaker  5:52  
It's really been it's been some kind of acceptance and questions really is in this room. Okay, if you can help us foster that engagement from local authorities who build community councils.

Unknown Speaker  6:02  
And central government needs to get things going, what is funding for this? Because at the moment, it's just costing me money. But I'm happy with that, I'd like to see it work.

Unknown Speaker  6:14  
link back to the resilience elements of wastelands of pipelines, or

Unknown Speaker  6:21  
things like that. So it's kind of fun, really, you know, people who can help.

Unknown Speaker  6:25  
And finally with

Unknown Speaker  5:12  
great enthusiasm, something we can do. That's great. Let's get on to it. And I got almost patient like, like, whenever anyone signs up to it, it's going everyday. So we're up to I think 78 In the last few weeks, we've been on the SGA side now it's gonna be fun for those guys coming in. We have really good support from the past as well. Two very nice organisations to work with. And so I'd recommend that and it's a nice little trio where we've got the technology side of the data and the training education and documenting. I'm also certain colour, Brandon's work. So other organisations that feel that they could help with their communities. It's really been it's been some kind of acceptance and questions really is in this room other people can do to help us foster that engagement. From local authorities who build community councils of Newcastle. Central Government is to get things going, and the other one is to find funding for this because it's just costing me money, but I'm happy with that. I'd like to see if it's going to work and link back to the resilience elements of waistbands. Things like that. So it's kind of fun, really. You know people who can help and finally with natural residents of Scotland has handled

Unknown Speaker  6:29  
actual residents of Scotland, Florida's hands up.

Unknown Speaker  6:37  
So I would urge you to find out because that is this appointment on the groupsets website, they'll tell you which. And if they do anything, if they don't tell them about the project. And if there's no one that that means by default,

Unknown Speaker  6:51  
you want to help the chair of the Council

Unknown Speaker  6:55  
get involved with?

Unknown Speaker  6:37  
so badly to find out because I've been cancelled on the group's website, they'll tell you and if they do anything, if they don't tell them about the project, and if there's no one that that means by default urs. You want to help the chair of the Council and public relations getting by involved with Newcastle?

Unknown Speaker  7:06  
Questions?

Unknown Speaker  7:26  
Yes, absolutely, that's fine. And that happens in Wales at the moment, so we try to as many as they can to share data to lower tier of public sector, lack of information, the moment they can see parish councils as many channels as

Unknown Speaker  7:41  
possible. So yes, I'm having a local, being shut down to a community councils, they can turn those layers on as long as they're designing their own

Unknown Speaker  7:49  
means that they can build it in context to the higher policies.

Unknown Speaker  7:55  
So acknowledge

Unknown Speaker  7:26  
Yes, absolutely, that's probably the principle that happens. In Wales at the moment, so we're trying to share data to a lower tier of public sector, lack of information. The moment they can see parish councils as many channels as possible. So, yes, I'm having a local plan being shut down to a community councils, they can turn those layers on as long as they're designing their own little place by me means that you can build it in context to the higher policies. So, acknowledge it and share it. Strategy and that's

Unknown Speaker  7:58  
and share strategy plans. That's probably.

Unknown Speaker  8:13  
February,

Unknown Speaker  8:15  
which is why Simon is talking to you.

Unknown Speaker  8:18  
But every cancer is what's better for manufacturers have produced a local development plan that ties into national planning framework is now your development plan. Because it's the newest development plan. So especially government, I know part of this process probably for the first time, because

Unknown Speaker  8:32  
we have to put our plans online. We're trying to get GDS online, which is why we work with the improvement service. So I'm trying to coordinate that because there is medical guidance coming about what the strategy should look like, what are

Unknown Speaker  8:44  
the key optimal, we'll have to do introduce it is called place efficiency assessment,

Unknown Speaker  8:49  
under 18, about what it's like to live in the places we have across Scotland, and there are a few.

Unknown Speaker  8:56  
But we actually have to talk to Lt. And then once we've done a plan, we've got to consult again and we've got to sort of

Unknown Speaker  9:02  
push us towards communities the difficulty is talking to not the usual suspects,

Unknown Speaker  9:06  
which is where I might

Unknown Speaker  8:07  
it February, which is why Simon is talking to you. But every cancers what's better for manufacturers have produced a local development plan. That ties into national planning your development plan, because it's the newest health plan, so especially government, I know part of this process. We have to put our plans online. We're trying to get GDS online, which is why we work with improvement service. So I'm trying to coordinate that because there is medical guidance coming from government about what the strategy should look like. What are your people introduce it is complexity assessment, under 18, about what it's like to live in the places we have across Scotland, and there are a few things that we actually have to talk about the ability and then once we've got a plan we've got to consult again. I spoke to the sort of big push for sports communities. The difficulty is talking to the usual suspects, which is where I might match with

Unknown Speaker  9:12  
be structured

Unknown Speaker  9:13  
about something slightly different. So parish councils have castles, they have budget, and they can deal with except they say

Unknown Speaker  9:21  
I'd like to see that formalised in England.

Unknown Speaker  9:25  
And so I'd like to see how it's to help people. Yes, they need to

Unknown Speaker  9:31  
see,

Unknown Speaker  9:33  
but

Unknown Speaker  9:38  
because we all get engaged

Unknown Speaker  9:41  
and we just have to mentor yesterday

Unknown Speaker  9:12  
the structure of wealth, so it's slightly different. So parish councils have castles they have budget, except they say John I'd like to see that former England batsman. And so I'd like to see how it's to young people. Yes, they need to but I because we all get engaged and we just have to Metro yesterday guys are happy to be selected, but getting.

Unknown Speaker  9:46  
but I'm getting there

Unknown Speaker  9:59  
I clicked

Unknown Speaker  10:00  
You

Unknown Speaker  10:03  
Local authorities will never know

know

Unknown Speaker  10:10  
some of the biggest administrative divisions in Europe, democracy it's solely

Unknown Speaker  10:17  
important

Unknown Speaker  10:19  
to be accepted as foreign funding. They need some kind of formality and

Unknown Speaker  10:25  
that's why I thought

Unknown Speaker  10:09  
especially some of the biggest administrative divisions in Europe. Democracy it's so important. To be outspoken as a foreigner say they need. They need some formality. And that's my thought. Let's try and see if it's a productive conversation.

Unknown Speaker  10:28  
a productive conversation

Unknown Speaker  10:31  
continues conversations over coffee. I would just like to ask everyone's all the speakers on this afternoon, David Abbey.

Unknown Speaker  10:32  
Conversations over coffee I would just like to ask everyone, all the speakers on this afternoon David Harvey tense very much

I think that's what it was working with organisations. It's a combination of company support. So that might be simple. Same thing with employee, identifying potential collaborative opportunities, funding opportunities, and the way that we're doing that, as Scott was talking about a call to action, if your organisation is intact, entirely easy to get nasty, but once we can then start to have the one to one protections for your organisation, like why does this company engagement and then the other element that we've been working on which depends on discussion today is where the sector from our funding partners perspective, what we're trying to do spectral sector and solvent and we can do that with something like location, Scotland, the vessel may not be going to have to make sure that the same sector and that's where I got involved with some statistics for the military from organisations within the engagement, that increasing salaries in membership fees that was spent last year we decided to do an online survey and that was really a fresh opportunity to gather some quantitative data to be able to lead us into the work that we're having. presenting some of the some of the stats from the online survey, and I don't make a lot of sales. So 70% of the community have experienced some sort of sales challenge to drip staff that 81% are struggling to retain staff and over 50% represent the future going forward, so that they gave us the confidence that we needed to take this to the next stage and some of the some of the challenges that came through it, I think have been evidence and indication they are here today. It was a combination of the mix of sales within the space sector. There's competing salaries, people have been drawn into different areas in different sectors. There's always been such a huge shift in technology within geospatial that perhaps some of the teams within some organisations aren't quite ready. So opportunities that that are happening to the company come through and through the work that we have a big table. And obviously listen to key stakeholders what we're beginning to forget what the standard is we're hoping we will come together and collaborate to try to tackle 20 or so timber. We have a second big table in November last year, and we're just beginning to draft up a roadmap on how we can all come together to address address fatalities. HR organisation, volunteers like why skills Yes, as a funding project, I can protect a piece of yours. But what else to get other legacy. We want the community to come together and set up some of the action items like work packages, and we can take some of that one. So that's our mission. For this year is that we continue to work together to ensure that we can get to the sector today. What's the conversation typically fantastic panellists want to hear from you guys at some point I'm starting to lean back from the morning session, Charles from ethical question to each of the panellists and get their conversation unconscious. And give me a thumbs up so the first question as to Charles and its owners perspective. What do you think the impacts? What are the risks if we don't try to tackle the challenges?

Unknown Speaker  3:25  
So as an employer, the situation we were in as much as we think we will continue to be able to develop these risks. It's the user base, people working for a government working for system integrators. organisation, especially as data science is rising, geospatial skills are not there to consume capabilities. That's one of the biggest threats is not as important. I think we'd be manageable. But I think we're in a lucky position with the major organisations it's really quite often good organisation that we struggle to have them adopt them or use techniques to do that. Because of the lack of skills and understanding of data scientists do not come from GIS. GIS people quite often don't come at the level of seniority to try and drive through that. And that's the situation we see today. We see the underlying adoption of the principal level and unless we change is it gonna be more of a real concern for us and also, I see a real need to really understand the difference between patient information and anything that goes with that as one subject matter. And the use of the techniques which is in the management of information analysis, there are almost two separate things I was struck by earlier on. Finding mission is about understanding, replacing spine for narrative analysis. And that's just the physical results. Scientist means skills to be able to process information that was one of the missing parts of it.

Unknown Speaker  4:59  
I think we confuse the skillsets to really focus on valuable resources and the use of geospatial competence the skills problem because we're looking at the woman

Unknown Speaker  5:10  
and I suggested that that ties into some competitions that can we can show that besides that this is excellent.

Unknown Speaker  5:39  
It's a bit of an art. It's something we call spatial bacosides which just is deleting values and cycles. They should be connected because it doesn't matter. If we look at transitioning or the news.

Unknown Speaker  6:03  
From an SEO perspective, that is a combination of lots of different bits of data is very much about what is fair and has nothing to do that is all this strange, arbitrary, do jobs which they are to do, which is not easy.

Unknown Speaker  6:25  
But there's a point in

Unknown Speaker  6:30  
becoming more data skills and be the centre of much more genius goes.

Unknown Speaker  6:39  
Obviously, national organisations to be compassionate obviously is essential. But what are your

Unknown Speaker  6:50  
skills? So I'm not at old plans. They are, but a little bit of words. And in the last few years, we've come to a tonne of words and because they complete disconnecting councils when the plant just vanished, and GIS or that the digital map making tool came in, they took it away for the professionals and they gave it to the person who left school at 16. I thought those entities in there in that category because some of them just because they are poor people and you get to the horrible situation. I should be very rural. intimidated, I got access to it and I hate that I come into you destroy totally to that person over there. And then print out handed to you. And we still have a situation where contracts often very recently, where we gave our spatial data to somebody to a consultant, they use digital tools and others to make analyse it and then they give it back to as a PDF. And people just go back and submit the original Lectrosonics. From my perspective, the skills that the funds are the future been taught and they've been taught and your toolset they've been taught on on QGIS have ever been taught to do analytical so lots of different data and analyse it. I'm not an architect, architect. I'm not a transport feature or whatever. I just think about planning and how faces I often say what I do is pick a place based approach using nature based solutions to create the fact that that place spaces as many possible places that you haven't captured, and that nature based solutions can improve meaning that any action any plan, any building, anything you do in a geospatial place should do no harm to social cohesion, human or habitat, health and well being human or habitat. Economy, environment, biodiversity, all at the same time. So if you're building a bridge, and you're making that impact on that community, stop and adapt that mitigate. Look at the bigger picture. It's all happening in a safe space place. And I want to be able to click on a thing that I might get a video on the person that lives there telling you what it's like to live in that place. And I might get a picture that gets drawn I might get a sound recording and I might get some maps and all that is data that allows us to build an evidence base that we can use to make better places that will make people feel healthier, happier, more resilient and stronger.

Unknown Speaker  8:53  
from a sales perspective. How do you change that attitude so that

Unknown Speaker  9:00  
there is a number of things most councils don't have a GISP wasn't has four people per city that really has been identified but don't have access to digital mapping. So they collect data on that the HR functions is aged. The new ones can we get into being trained by investors anybody being trained to find or being trained to use? The job is a big trend, then coming into cast to be the solution. It's also needed. There needs to be a concerted effort between my professional auditor the rtpi Ati patients got yours improvement service, start making a big thing out of the professionals that deal with geography, faces and places because actually that's a skill set that's needed for sustainability. If you want to reference the IPCC report that came out in 2006. That was the Climate report number six as a supplement for policymakers and it says one percenter that the first thing you need is urban planning. That's worldwide. And I think that's a great resource, but we need to kind of make people aware, make visible, the skill sets that are needed. If a kid wants to go into it. It should be a job for a

Unknown Speaker  10:08  
foreigner. That's exactly what we're trying to do. Through this work. We're working in partnership with a variety of organisations to try to get out there and it is what I feel like it was when we look at the organisations organisations today instead of trying to do this, but it's quite fragmented and the natural fund that you're trying to put together this is a big complaint, message and part of that as interest is trying to showcase that there are options here.

Unknown Speaker  10:33  
The passive table just really depends also from a scaling perspective. Hopefully, this won't be as bad. I think a lot of that has to do with the language and terminology because

Unknown Speaker  10:48  
a lot of these sections about what we call shells as a GIS as a new species application. And I think that's part of the value perspective as well because depending on who we're speaking to, it may not use the same technology and those opportunities. I suppose I wanted to open up for so you can return to what your questions are worth it. We're gonna keep digging to get your understanding from the perspective of suicide. Do you have challenges and experiences? Is your organisation already doing something in the space that we can tie in with so I'll hand it over to four three ones.

Unknown Speaker  11:26  
Simon's conference

Unknown Speaker  11:32  
focuses on healing for certain patients and medical professionals in Europe in the US

Unknown Speaker  11:45  
are excited the iron is in all sectors data sciences is going to change a stage that will continue to change every single sector in different places in different ways. It's talking about authorities for example, we have a situation where sports so often they are not visible. They're not data savvy people generally, if we have a burgeoning tech sector in your team, the other side of the job will not be working for a big tech company. When you guys go into the council a couple years ago, we bought the biggest data science team medical authority in Scotland. That's the name looked at across the council how many people would be classed as using data in video services and the rate of 100 people that didn't see that was you're not selling. Those are the people that you were going to have to train up because the reality is it will never be enough. Specialist GIS people coming out from masters courses or undergraduate courses. The future of AI and data and digital is upscaling which is really hard to do. Most organisations barely trained their staff, typical CDE budget this we're talking about technically. So how do you take that content we've done because it's a big thing and bringing people on the journey and that's probably one of the things that we are you can do that. Again so the answer to this because you're gonna have to go back to school you're gonna have an education system that can deliver what the economy needs.

Unknown Speaker  13:25  
as well. You don't have one undergraduate planning courses, one visit company great. Let's just close this and close it because it can't get enough foreign students to bankrolling because the campaign on the fact that students get paid. So we now have that we have queens, and Belfast. So we never had the rest of them to get them to school. Get them to then go into geography, and then planning professional fighting with the other geography based professions to get into both go into planning, because we need your pencils. But when we do get bright spot for pencils, as soon as the private sector sees that they get wound up, we lose them. There is a real issue about not shouting from the rooftops that our professions are sexy. They're interesting, but doing the right thing is sustainability and climate are the kids. And these are the professionals that are going to have the answers to how you do it. They're going to be the ones that I've been working with. And I'm arguing to try and keep the ice person I'm trying to self sacrifice my oxygen because we reckon we can save our parts department of fortune. Because they just like to collect the data. And we can stay out of our education pocket and do the comprehensive budget situation because we don't see that that's the issue. We're using data that was a whole big issue about understanding

Unknown Speaker  14:43  
gender general data science, some computer

Unknown Speaker  14:52  
stuff is also what you know about trees checkmarks and reports. We know that's true. You don't know which actually don't ask me did I? Okay, it's gonna be excellent, awesome question about batteries. So when I go back as money, so that's not good enough, because we need to plan about what to do because we're also being pushed aside because it's a bunch of trees that are gonna die from to calculate the fact that people don't understand what they do with data, what it could do, and like, more easy how it can save money and how you can use the other side of that is when you get funding opportunities from the government. Or the UK Government or others when they ask for evidence,

Unknown Speaker  15:39  
especially on a Christian organisation, management at the senior people decision can be done. Things are not doing something to be exactly what government can do, but it doesn't reach the right levels either in the public sector. I would say

Unknown Speaker  15:57  
that not enough people. Come back to your question. We definitely see deficit understanding. We see people who are very very good they understand they just don't understand that there's things that are simply added to your structure if they don't have the basic tools to back up people. I can personally just be doing a really good fundamental work on the problem of trying to aggregate a person's problem themselves. And they don't know that they're really good people. There is definitely a deficit expressed in the US and we're seeing a drop optimism optimal levels. And secondly, in the wider technical community level, computer scientists with the field is something we're not getting through on this understanding. And that's what really think about in the world. And in wider society

Unknown Speaker  16:48  
on Saturday, so we have a strategy for your project and the challenges posed by the health data, and what can we get back and pull that out? Because we know at some point, you're going to prescribe something, hopefully well. So it's saving, you might look at mental health services, that money provide great space, but we find the evidence might eventually be able to have a discussion about cause and effect. But that mental depression medicine prescription falling in Drumchapel at that point in time might just be because we provided a cycleway or a great park or something where they can go out for a walk rather than taking lessons. But there's a complete disconnect about what people will do with that information and who needs it? Do you get silence people recreated

Unknown Speaker  17:33  
data? Because I suspect that that's what my question is actually. Is it? Too much production to make

Unknown Speaker  17:51  
use of

Unknown Speaker  17:58  
this and it's the within local authorities is that you never start a business and sort of say, Here's two things you got to do is do those things and your processes. That manager or that team has got to produce that results and trying to get the strategic data that other people need to get the attention get the data from somewhere else. Use across silos in different ways but for years, but the last the last level of protein, and now it's not that much of a large area, but the GIS team has evolved and developed and worked into more data analysis using different using the skills they are producing things like just run all the different tools to do some further analysis shows increased. Results processing

Unknown Speaker  19:21  
so, we do some spatial analysis on your clients to see if there's any correlation between where they are at the site. We just want You

Unknown Speaker  0:03  
Innovation and the euro public sector, as usual, is delivering services you're supposed to. It's very hard as it is. And that's it. I don't find anything. I liken it to asking a firefighter respecting. You just went through a process that will probably take less and less money. There will be more we'll be leaving towards the touchstone that people don't coming into the workforce. There'll be major demand on services. How do you what's your capacity in that context? So the answer is, yes, which which means you've been in automation for your for your time that comes up, just got to the limit of service, and that is understandable, but will be the change will take decades. And the impact and benefits that we could get from change, which would be massive,

Unknown Speaker  0:47  
and we'll get back to do much more efficient here do you think conference has been overwhelmingly public sector? The vast untapped resources out there of the private sector? And I think it's maybe something in a way that conversation we're having and faculty determined to give away data. It's actually undermining value proposition

Unknown Speaker  1:08  
eight and don't have any money to pay you. We'd love to pay you but we don't spend budgets be in previous point is that that is what I'm actually selling as a private sector that you want making that data if it's the baseline user experience of the baseline data being resold to cancelled again and again and again and again. That's

Unknown Speaker  1:24  
what I want you to do stop giving stuff away.

Unknown Speaker  1:27  
Yeah, but what we want to do, we're a we can't we can't buy what you want to sell. So we will have no budget. So we'll work with the improvement service to create a free open source because that's the only way we can use a budget. I have no budget to buy anything at the minute as part of the planning 120 budget. I get hit by one single challenge. That's 80 grand for two and I'm wiped out coat. The regulating social budget has reinvented education project. We struggled to pay for things we can't buy extra tools, we need to invent it ourselves. What we want is to be able to work in partnership and collaboration. only way we can pay you oneself is if we have the time to visit other government bodies to get funding that would allow us to pay we don't even have the time to put together a

Unknown Speaker  2:11  
series of ambitious targets in the UK and yet, you probably need to change them or build an investment to make that happen. Because ultimately, it's a planning issue. It's an infrastructure planning issue. It's entirely based based but you're talking about emissions and borders. are an aspect to update the granular level of where things are that you're using systems or as a project coordinator because we need so much gas to cover what's above and it's it's obviously it's all GIS driven and we can add on to that but it's your is going to be a big

Unknown Speaker  2:43  
task, ask questions. So the national planning framework, it challenges the councils and community to do certain things in different ways. But local government within Scotland is based on 100 year old model. It hasn't changed how it set up before. It's changed a bit because a lot of us are working at home and the ones who refused to come back into the office just last three months. That's a sign but if you want to work in the private sector, you have to collaborate co produce. But there's the other issue we've got and you might have a mistake. We used to be able to get funding for research programmes called Horizon, but because you can't get research at the minute, so we try to work with guys beginning they've got 10 million has come to present in that money. So what Hallward PhD students from it on obviously, I don't apologise to anybody that's in here, but I'm meant to be helping you to use your cell phone to talk about research. I first thought I had to keep going short because you need to get

Unknown Speaker  3:37  
attractive and Jason only because it wasn't efficient for us is critical

Unknown Speaker  3:51  
to what we're trying to do. I've already started some of these conversations, but we do need to collectively come together to provide

Unknown Speaker  4:04  
climate emergency crisis is a huge opportunity. You cannot solve that problem without understanding location spatial everything else and that's a very attractive area. But I also think that the only way of solving that crisis is we have to be trapped by climate change. So there's a combination of we probably should have some sort of cool TV programme with some younger lenders, because that will help. But we have to make sure people understand that in order to tackle problems. We have special purchase

Unknown Speaker  4:38  
this is

Unknown Speaker  4:49  
a call to action. Please get in touch applications. Obviously, opposition drive forward challenges talking in some projects and that's kind of computers so please don't get more information

Unknown Speaker  5:15  
Thank you think the theme, and then you basically try and find people who might be able to talk to that theme. and you get a call for speak out and it's definitely silence. I think today we've we've got this theme. I think the talks have come together in a remarkable week, and that they have all been. So I'd like to thank all the speakers are the contributions. We've summarised data. We've also heard this not just data it's an hour. It's treating these incidences creating intelligent systems in the world in terms of learning lessons to pay attention to the stuff we do take away lessons for solving. Resilience with old fashioned deep passion as your how we not only sustain what we got, we followed the mission of LDS enterprise to grow with the geospatial ecosystem that sort of jumped. So we find local people from deep in the coal mines we've gone back into ancient history 6000 Yesterday more than 30 hours we've done really really well we wanted masters army and we fight we predicted predict future and actually it's not wait where we are at present is where we're going to use that crystal ball is making sure that the intelligence in that crystal ball is there so that we can a whether it be for security, whether it be for natural hazards and topically company, can we really make a difference and really make people's lives better through that. So thank you. Again, thank you to all the speakers for the contributions which have been absolutely fantastic talks. Thank you to the chairs of the sessions. Thank you to the committee on your notes this morning. So I want to put that although you might think very much for your help in terms of in this together. It is not an easy job, I can assure you, but my colleagues, I've managed to work a little do get involved. They just got a group of a group of amateurs to do this because we think it's important to join to get involved. We're open to learning to come help. Thank you. Biggest thank you to all of you. We've been a real pleasure to be back in person and have these sidebar conversations been so important in terms of conference so I really enjoyed it. Hope you've enjoyed it. So thank you to these

Unknown Speaker  7:53  
two special industry secretaries joining us history to take advantage of buildings to be doing Scotland come again to this event. next year on diesel trains future people. I'm standing between you and

Unknown Speaker  8:12  
thank you very much indeed for your contributions. One final advice tonight for my colleagues if you can take your lunch. And you can unclip the cardboard gonna use it in one box.

Unknown Speaker  8:23  
You
